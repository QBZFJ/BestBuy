    <title>Essential for any jazz fan</title>
    <comment>Bottom line: Buy all of the Jazz Icons titles. Starting with the Brubeck, this series is the pinnacle of jazz on DVD. The biggest stars in their prime, all of them beautifully shot and with gorgeous sound. Anyone remotely interested in American music needs to have the whole series, starting with the Brubeck, though the boxed sets are the best value overall.</comment>

    <title>Lives upto the expectations</title>
    <comment>While it would be hard for any movie to top the original Matrix, this movie attempts to do so. On some levels, it is the best Matrix movie yet. It goes out with a bang. Without ruining the ending, I will say that it is a climactic experience, and keeps you pinned to your seat thirsty for more every step of the way. This movie, as well as the previous 2, belong in the collections of action fans everywhere.</comment>

    <title>Great Game</title>
    <comment>While this is an old game, and does not have amazing graphics it has great long lived playablity. This is a game that if you are not to familiar with gaming, and don't want to spend HOURS learning which special key does what you can pick up in about 30 minutes and be hacking and slashing with the best of them.</comment>

    <title>Disappointed wiht hype</title>
    <comment>I bought some of these because the description says they are " so comforterable you'll wonder where the sound is coming from" ... WRONG they hurt my ears if I had them in for more than 5 min. I mean come on. gummy year on the exterior, but the ear peice frame is hard as rock and hurts to be in your ear, After 4 days of having these my left one went out, For no reason, but when I touch the wire it cuts in and out. I won't even try these again!</comment>

    <title>Gr8 Headphones</title>
    <comment>I got this headphones for my creative zen vision w, to start with i didnt like the headphones which came in with the player, So i bought an creative in ear ear plugs. First it sounded great then after 2 months my ear started to feel the pain. Then i decided to go far the Bose On the Ear headphones eventhough it was $170+. It sounds great with the player, i watch back to back movies in my player and still it doesnot hurt, The Soft leather which is in contact with the ear is very good, Sometimes my ear tend to get little warm but little warm for back to back movies should be OK i guess. I still think it is a bit overpriced eventhough its BOSE!!!</comment>

    <title>Pleasantly surprised!</title>
    <comment>I'm not a huge movie buff, so I can't tell you if this is 'Leo's' best or not...but I will say this. It's about the only movie released in the last year I'd be tempted to buy and take home! Suspenseful throughout, a good ending, and I thought all the actors did a good job (but I usually don't pick winners when the awards come around...just a fair warning). I thought it'd be good with the names it carries, but it by far surpassed expectation. Genre-wise, I'd put it something between Training Day and 16 Blocks. Great movie, I highly recommend it.</comment>

    <title>Great series!</title>
    <comment>This is a great series. I nice new look on the classic tale of Robin Hood. The acting is great, especially that of Keith Allen. It can sometimes be a pretty corny show, but if you don't let that bother you it is a very enjoyable show. It is clean, funny, and action packed. A truly creative look on the story of Robin Hood. It is a must see for all true Robin Hood fans.</comment>

    <title>Great Album</title>
    <comment>I find this album very very good,i have all the other ws albums and they are all good in their own way. This album has the distinct sound of the white stripes. Its kind of like a garage band mixed with a lot of funk. Whether its the driving beating drums of Meg White or the wailing voice and guitar of Jack White its an all around fantastic album!</comment>

    <title>Hot and extra Fuzzy</title>
    <comment>Great extras make rewatching and re-rewatching the film very enjoyable! The movie is well crafted with great direction. Kudos to the Brits for showing the US how to really do a "buddy cop" flick! The film is well paced with a reasonable amount of action, a great twist, excellent comic timing, and plenty of intra- and extra-genre references for the movie buff.</comment>

    <title>Good for your money</title>
    <comment>Excellent features like 8 group file(love it), shuffle with in each group or the entire collection, keyboard cd text entry is very helpfull as well. The only part that can be improved on is that you can only input up to 11 characters(not enough for artist, album info) and that it does not have for MP3 playing. The time for shuffle selection is around 20 seconds which is pretty good considering that it has to do a random selection between 300 discs and lots of songs.</comment>

    <title>THE Bag to have for the Notebook</title>
    <comment>This bag not only accomodates some of the largest notebooks around, but will also seemelessly adjust to smaller models. The design takes into consideration all of your other needs; from storage of accessories, and other devices like your P.D.A., cell-phone, and music player. You can even keep your music player safely inside, and run your headphones through the simple but ingenius slot made for just that purpose. The padding adds a layer of comfort and security you seldom find in any case on the market. There is just not enough to be said about this bag. If you need to store, carry, or show off your notebook, or just want to know it's safe, this is the product to buy.</comment>

Then, you are drawn into a charming. funny story remenicent of the best of the office, scrubs and your favorite romantic comedy. This is a chick flick for guys and a buddy picture for chicks. By the end I was grinning from ear to ear with tears in my eyes. A must see and one you will want to own and watch again and again.</comment>

    <title>Dresden Files is truly magical!!</title>
    <comment>Amazing as it may seem, the Sci-Fi Channel managed to get one show EXACTLY RIGHT!! This is the perfect series for people who love sci-fi, drama, mysteries, detective/cop shows, and still manages to have a good bit of humor &amp; sarcasm to make the whole thing hum! The Dresden Files is extremely well-written, superbly acted &amp; directed, has truly original stories, and is an absolute JOY to watch!! I would - &amp; HAVE - recommended this show &amp; it's DVD's to everyone I know! I can't wait until Season 2!!!</comment>

    <title>Biggest Change</title>
    <comment>Compared to "Our Gangs Dark Oath" (Aidens first debut), you wouldn't think this was the same band. Our Gangs Dark Oath features very fast melodic punk riffs with quite a bit of screaming. It was great for fans of Atreyu &amp; AFI. Shortly after the release of Our Gangs Dark Oath, Aiden introduced their biggest hit, "Nightmare Anatomy". Which was great for fans of My Chemical Romance &amp; Hawthorne Heights. They slowed it down just a tad, and had much less screaming, but was still able to maintain their large fan base. Last October they released an EP titled, "Rain in H*ll" which was very controversial. Many old fans did not like the change in Aiden's sound, but decided to stick with them just in case their next CD was going to return to the old style. Unfortunately, they were wrong. Conviction has almost no similarities to Our Gangs Dark Oath or Nightmare Anatomy. This CD is a much more mellow and emotional sound that I think works well for the band. They really got their act together and made a CD that is well worth sitting down and listening to 3 times in a row (in my opinion). The new sound kind of makes me think of a uniquely mashed together Billy Idol, My Chemical Romance and HIM. If you were hoping for a return of the old Aiden, think again. They have completely changed their sound and are sticking to it. Its all about doing what you love. So don't be bias to the new sound, and embark on it with an open mind.</comment>

    <title>Season 6: Justice, Phantoms, and Marriage</title>
    <comment>The continuing story of Clark Kent's transformation into The Man of Steel grows nearer and more dangerous. Clark (Tom Welling) must fight his way out of the Phantom Zone to stop Zod, who has possessed the body of Lex (Michael Rosenbaum). In his escape Clark accidentally releases prisoners from the Phantom Zone and must recapture them. In season 6 we are introduced to an old classmate of Lex's, Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley), who has won the affection of Lois (Erica Durance), and is set on ruining Lex's plans of building an army of super soldiers. Clark and Oliver must go into "league" with other heroes to bring Lex to "justice." However Clark is a little preoccupied by Lex and Lana's growing relationship and must decided to intervine or let Lana (Kristin Kreuk) go forever. This season has it all. From Lois Lane's start as journalist to Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore). Season 6 of Smallville gives you some great episodes with great emotional conflict. Clark and Lex take one step closer to their destiny as mortal enemies!</comment>

    <comment>"Carry On" is hands down a fantasic album. Chris Cornell is constantly pulling out different styles, and keeping his music fresh...and this CD definitely shows this. It's a must have for any Cornell fan, or just someone looking to enjoy some great music.</comment>

    <comment>Well, I thought that I would never be able to play a video game well at all.....you see I am a mother of two and they always made fun of me. I bought this for my husband for Fathers Day!! What a hit. Everyone in our family has played some kind of instrument so we all love music. Great family time. Rock and Roll music was a big part of my teenage years, BUT to actually get to play "FreeBird" gave me thousand of thrills. I was there at the last concert that Lynard Skynard played. AND YES, I AM A 51 YEAR OLD WOMAN, AND CAN PLAY GUITAR HERO II. So, ladies step up to the Gibson!!!!!!</comment>

    <title>Season 2: Green Means Stop, Red Means Go</title>
    <comment>When Season 1 ended Jonathan Kent (John Schneider) had risked a tornado to protect his families secret, Lex (Michael Rosenbaum) must decide the fate of his father, and Clark (Tom Welling) runs into a tornado that had engulfed Lana (Kristin Kreuk). The story of a small Kansas town that will spawn the greasest hero ever continues. Clark's secret is becoming to big to hide to his friends and someone finds out about his powers. Lex must put his synicism aside and let someone into his heart, and Lana makes a discovery that will change her life forever. Clarks life grows more complicated when he meets a scientist, played by Christopher Reeves, who tells him he is the only surivior of an alien planet. His relationship with Lana grows closer, and a red meteor shows up that will allow him to "let loose." This was a greatest season as far as moving the characters along. Clark finds out where he comes from and what his birth parents had planned for him. He also has a bumpy love life in the triangle with him, Lana, and Chloe (Allison Mack). This is kinda Clark and Lex's high point, after this season it starts to fade as both head towards their destiny.</comment>

    <title>A Fun Japanese Drama</title>
    <comment>Although a bit cheesy at times, once you get past that, this is an incredibly funny and entertaining drama. The characters are great and the story is very unique. I'd have to say I highly recomend this to any Japanese Drama fan.</comment>

    <title>Verrrry Interesting Show</title>
    <comment>Ever hear of horrible crime commited and wonder "What were they thinking?", or "What could bring a person to do such a thing?!"....well this show answers those questions in a very slick, very captivating way. The characters are believable as they go about the business of not only solving the crime, but explaining, however brutal, why it happened. This show is not for the timid or easily shocked nor is it for the very young. The whole psychology behind some of the worst crimes against humanity is played out in every episode in not so much a visually graphic way, but moreso in the dialog and even more in what is not said, as your mind puts together the string of events that led up to the "unsub" as they are called in the show, meaning the unknown subject that did the horrible deed. Just as CSI goes into the physical science of solving crimes, this show goes into the psychology of solving crimes. What could make a person do such a thing? Watch this show and find out.</comment>

    <title>Where to start.....</title>
    <comment>Where to start? Well lets take a look. None of the tracks on this CD are original to the movie, they are a bunch of corporate pasted sound bytes, which some (aka most) didnt even make it into the movie with 30 seconds of play time. Save your $ for the score if/when it ever gets released</comment>

    <title>Works great!</title>
    <comment>I wanted to keep my older PS/2 keyboard and mouse. So I paired this KVM switch with a Dynex PS/2-to-USB converter - works great! You my have to get used to double-tapping the scroll-lock button very quickly though to make the switch from one PC to another. Regardless, the monitor image is not blurry and the shared audio is a great plus.</comment>

    <comment>Mario Party 8 is a great game but not much different then the other mario party games. The biggest change is how you play the game with the Wii remote. The mini games are fun and they also have added some new game boards to play on. It is a disappointment they dont support widescreen and the graphics are not that good and look the same as the Gamecube. But the game is still fun and has lots of mini games. I recommend a purchase and I think you will like the game.</comment>

    <title>Show me the classics</title>
    <comment>I made the mistake of grabbing this box set off the shelf as I was about to purchase a new DVD player. There are few, if any, real classics in this set of DVDs. Many are not sci-fi films. Hercules adventures are fantasy, not sci-fi, and you will find many of these sword and sandal flicks here. Frankenstein and The Day the Earth Stood Still are classic sci-fi films. You will not find these films here. Most of the movies in this set are second rate even compared to Grade B films like Invisible Invaders or The Brain from Planet Arius. Children may enjoy some of these, though the pace is slow and the action is lacking in most of these movies, especially compared to today's films, but for the sci-fi afficionado or nostalgic sci-fi fan, this box set is disappointing.</comment>

    <title>BRAIN CANDY</title>
    <comment>This is one that Tom Berringer probably would like to forget, but I love it. It has a fun premise harking back to the days of the Saturday morning western, when the good guys always wore white hats and you were sure who the bad guys were. Yeah, yeah, it's not a great movie, but it certainly is fun to watch. It has some remarkably ridiculous situations and some great lines that almost make you take a double take. My family and I have seen this movie many times and laugh through it each time. When you don't want to think too much, just have some fun, you need some brain candy and that is what this is. Silly, funny brain candy!</comment>

    <comment>This is one of the best boxed sets out there Darren Mcgavin is incredible as Kolchak, the stories are fun and you cant beat the interaction between the cast, this is one boxed set that is worth 50$ all 20 episodes cant beat it, so for 34 dollars pick it up, you will not regret it...</comment>

It's also really cool to see all that went into the making of "Everybody." This DVD is DEFINETLY a must have!!!</comment>

    <title>Not what hyped up to be!!</title>
    <comment>For anyone who saw this movie, you probably were very disappointed by this game. It's very elementary, with mostly chase and retrieve missions and a sub-par move list and weapons for the characters. The coolest part of the game is the ability to transform on the fly, but even that wears off after the first hour. Also, its annoying that any and everything you make contact with is DESTROYED. Cars, buildings, landmarks, etc. The game has a good concept, but seemed rushed. They should try again and develop a more indepth weapons/fighting system and make the missions more involving. A big letdown overall.</comment>

    <comment>These four DVDs are filled with 19 beautiful episodes of life in the Smokey Mountains as lived a century ago. It is a great series based on the book Christy written by Catherine Marshall and can be enjoyed by the whole family. I just wish there were more of this type movies available.</comment>

    <title>Please know what you're getting</title>
    <comment>This is most certainly not worth the $50 price tag. It's like an expansion pack. There are only 30 songs. A few of the characters were removed. The unlock shop only has half of what it used to. The gameplay itself is still just as perfect as it was on GHII, and the song selection depends on personal preferance but I thought it was decent. It looks pretty good if you can turn on the progressive scan mode (480p). But I see it as getting half of what either of the first two games offered, so it should cost half as much. I was able to take advantage of the early online offer and pay $40 plus get a $15 gift card, so looking at it that way, this is a great game to get for $25. Wait until the price comes down to that level.</comment>

    <comment>Brick caught many by surprise with its engaging plot and outstanding performances by its bright, young cast. It was not as highly publicized as the other movies in 2006, which allowed it to sneak up on the majority of its audience and win them over. This sleeper hit should find its way into any true movie fans' collection.</comment>

    <title>Well done!!!</title>
    <comment>Constantine doesn't disappoint on this long awaited freshman release. Even though he doesn't pick a distinctive genre or style, this CD does not disappoint. I like a variety of music and can get bored when an artist chooses to have all the songs sound the same, well Constantine does just the opposite on this CD. There is something for everyone on this CD and that is what I like the most, outside of Mr. Maroulis's singing voice. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.</comment>

    <title>Heart Felt Musicianship</title>
    <comment>Mae really pushed themselves to expand their creativity with this record. Once again, the members have each brought everything they had to the table, to produce a record that takes you into a magical dreamworld, and allows you to dismiss the chaos of the world around you.</comment>

    <title>Amazing CD</title>
    <comment>Mae is an amazing band. I first fell in love with them after I saw them perform as the opening act for Relient K. After the show, I went home and downloaded their previous two albums, eagerly awaiting this new release. I must say, this album does not dissapoint. It deffinately reflects growth from their previous two releases. From the music to the lyrics, this is without a doubt a great buy. If you are a fan of the somewhat emo and indie genres, this is, for sure, a must have for your collection.</comment>

    <title>not that impressed</title>
    <comment>I've never played a Mario Party game and decided to rent this game to see what the hype was about. Although the numerous mini-games were fun for a short time, the game is more of an annoyance when you have a larger party. I rented it again to make sure that I didn't get the wrong impression the first time and the same feeling about the game was there. I wasn't too impressed with the game. I'm glad I rented it (although it was a free rental through Blockbuster) as I would have considered it a waste of money to buy.</comment>

    <title>Really good stand for up to 42" plasmas as well.</title>
    <comment>I bought the Panasonic th42pz700 plasma to put on top of this stand. It sticks out just a tiny bit, but it looks like the tv was made for the stand. It is built pretty solid (kids not climbing on it of course). The middle shelf was even tall enough for my center channel (Boston Acoustics VR-10 center channel, puts others to shame).</comment>

    <comment>This is the only DVD media I will use. Burned over 1,000 with very few coasters. (99% of coasters occured because I had my screen saver turned on while burning.) I use them primarily for data archives. Fast and reliable. The label side has plenty of room to write on.</comment>

    <title>Great Buy</title>
    <comment>I purchased this wireless set-up for my apt. about 2 months ago. I love it. It works very well about 98% of the time. Occasionally there will be a 'pop' in the speakers, usually if you have a wireless laptop around. I have mine positioned about 10ft away from the transmitter under my couch. There is a slight hissing noise if the wireless reciever volume is turned up high and what you are watching doesn't have much surround sound. Overall, I highly recommend this set up especially if you don't want wires running across your living room.</comment>

    <comment>OK so this is probably the funniest movie ever - second only to Shaun of the Dead from the same guys (Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, &amp; Nick Frost). Watch Shaun of the Dead first so that you catch all of this movie's references to it. Try to figure out who plays Simon Skinner during the movie - I absolutely loved his character.</comment>

And it's has the most popular line in any movie since Scarface. Are you talking to me?</comment>

    <title>Simple but Complete</title>
    <comment>You take that theme and run with it Reznor! It's almost like Trent finished reading his copy of 1984 and sat down to write this album. This time it is evident that felt somthing with the project, unlike previous outings (the fragile, I remember reading the lyrics from that album to a friend completely floored with their simplicity and clicheness) Passion, disgust, betrayed, volnerable. When you listen to this album you know that these are the songs that will feel timless the way they did on Downward Spiral. Classics to be had for sure. Some areas need polish, like the end of "The Great Destroyer" What the heck was that all about. Suddenly we bombarded with this horrible drum and bass ballad that sounds like it was thrown together on the mtv music generator. I skip to the next song about one minute into that song. It's a shame too, the begining is great. Don't let that stop you, this is a great album. Most nin fans will buy anything with Trents name on it though, anyone, myself included, knows that every time they look at their copy of the Natural Born Killers sound trac.</comment>

    <title>Excellent Wireless Router</title>
    <comment>I purchased this router to replace my Linksys WRT54G. The GIGABIT switch is an excellent feature if you have the right computer hardware. I upgraded my laptop with a d-link DWA-643 wireless N card to complement this router and have not been disappointed performance. I was having Xbox Live and Playstation Network connection issues with the WRT54G, this router completely resolved those issues. The QOS interface is excellent and keeps those connections prioritized as necessary. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone in the market for a wireless N solution. It is well worth the price.</comment>

    <title>A Decent Tripod</title>
    <comment>While it is not the sturdiest tripod out there, this is definitely a decent item for the money. I use it with a Canon Rebel XTi with the 18-55 kit lens and the 75-300 telephoto. It supports both well. Adjustment is easy enough to do. I was wary of the plastic construction of the tilt plate and hinge, but these have turned out to be fine for my use. The quick release mechanism works nicely once you get used to it. You are provided with 2 mount plates that attach to the standard screw mounts on your camera or big lens. Overall.....it's inexpensive but not cheap. If you need a super strong &amp; heavy tripod, you might want to consider others. But for the average photographer this should do nicely. It's a good product at a fair price. I think the only real down side to this tripod is that it would be nice if it had a plate with a standard "screw-wheel" for those who don't want to mess with the quick release. It would also be nice if BestBuy would stock extra mount plates. If you start adding big lenses to your bag, you will need more.</comment>

    <title>well written, great action</title>
    <comment>with an ensemble cast and some of the best written lines in an action film, True Romance delivers. Slater and Arquette do a wonderful job as a couple of newlyweds on the run from the mob with a suitcase full of drugs. The come in contact with some of the most colorful characters you've ever seen who all have the most wonderfully written lines (Brad Pitt will make you laugh till you cry). To top it off, this is a Tony Scott film, so it also delivers in the way of action that is down right intense in multiple scenes. This is a required edition to any action buff's library.</comment>

    <title>Absolutely Hilarious</title>
    <comment>This is a must have!!! Not only is Ricky Gervais funny, but the numerous stars are too! In this two-disc comedy you have stars like Orlando Bloom, David Bowie, Chris Martin, and Sir Ian McKellen who give the show their all when they deliver their comedic lines. If the show wasn't funny enough, the extras are hilarious! One of the funniest ones is 'Taping Nigel', where Ricky tapes (duct tape) his editor in weird and funny ways. This is definately something for those people who want a laugh!</comment>

    <title>A Relentlessly Pleasing Sophomore Effort!</title>
    <comment>The first time I heard of Eisley was at least four or five years ago. I remember watching MTV and seeing them featured on "You Hear It First." At that time, this underdog band from Texas had little to show for their efforts except for an EP and a tour with Coldplay. Still, the band aroused my interest, and I kept them on my radar. It wasn't until I saw them live in January of 2005 that I finally fell in love with them. Their debut full-length album was released just a few weeks later, and I can remember rushing into my local store minutes after they opened so that I could get a copy. "Room Noises" was a marvelous and wonderful album. It is one of the few albums that you can listen and just drift off to. The DuPree sisters were able to craft stories and imagery that was simply beyond their years, and the music they created was absolutely dreamy. It's been about 2 1/2 years since then and my hopes have been high for another brilliant album for some time. The question is, "Does 'Combinations' live up to it's predecessor?" When you hit "Play" on your CD player, it's immediately clear that what you are about to hear will sound very little like "Room Noises." The lead-off track, "Many Funerals" is a very straight-forward rock track, completely unlike anything we've heard from the band before. In the chorus, the sisters sing "Break, break down!" over an aggressive guitar and bass. Is this really Eisley? Indeed, it is. While the song isn't bad by any means, it can definitely catch you off guard if you're not anticipating it. Get used to it though. Eisley takes a much more traditional approach to making music this time around. Their lyrics are much more straightforward now, often singing about things that are relatable rather than fairies and forests. At the same time though, their sound is more polished and they sound more cohesive as a band than they ever have before. Their hooks are stronger, and they play their instruments with confidence. It's a trade off, because even though they sound much more talented on "Combinations," they don't sound as dreamy and innocent as they once did. The first single, "Invasion," is really the closest that the DuPrees come to capturing the wanderlust of "Room Noises." Here, the sisters sing "Ooh, something's not right" in a wavy vocal style that sounds very familiar, very comforting. The next song, "Taking Control" is my personal favorite on the album. It sounds like nothing that they've done before, but the chorus is unbelievably infectious. The pianos, guitars, drums, and vocals blend perfectly to form a truly memorable pop rock song. The band slows down a bit on "Go Away," the album's first real ballad, and a showcase for the group's unparalleled ability to harmonize with one another. When they sing "Go away, go away and leave me on my own" it moved me in a way that few songs have been able to this year, and as such, it stands out on the album. "Come Clean" is another ballad, but this time the vocals are not as much of a group effort. At the same time, however, the band shows off their talent on their respective instruments. Gentle guitar plucks and the frantic strums of a mandolin form the backdrop for this very soothing song. The song ends with the band singing "Come clean all around me" together before fading into the sounds of children playing. Beautiful. "Ten Cent Blues" takes a very real look at relationships and the feeling of not being able to compete with someone to whom you feel you are physically inferior to. She sings about how the other girl is cheesy, and has no wit before conceding "I'm sorry I don't have her face, and I'm probably gonna lose this race." It's a far cry from Eisley of old, but it's nice to hear the earnest words of an artist every now and then rather than just fictional tales. "Combinations" wraps up with the bizarre, yet impressive "A Sight To Behold," the cutesy, yet dull title track, and the undeniably gorgeous and lullabye-like "If You're Wondering." It's a brief, but welcomed trip back to the fantasy world of earlier Eisley albums. When it's all said and done, I can't help but have mixed feelings about "Combinations." It's obvious to me that the DuPrees have grown substantially as musicians since I first saw them play live several years ago, and their music has become more solid because of it. However, I miss the fantasy and wanderlust of "Room Noises" and their earlier EPs very much. I suppose it's just something I'll have to get over, because at it's core "Combinations" is a very impressive album. It's a work that can stand on it's own, apart from their past recordings. It may not be as immediately endearing, but Eisley has not let us down. Recommended for fans of Eisley, Sixpence None the Richer, and anyone who wants to hear the best Tyler, Texas has to offer. Key Tracks: 1. "Many Funerals" 2. "Taking Control" 3. "Go Away" 4. "Come Clean" 5. "If You're Wondering" 7 out of 10 Stars</comment>

    <title>Great Purchase from BestBuy</title>
    <comment>This entertainment set changed my husbands life ! He loved the fact that it opened to reveal more storage and took up less space ! I would recommend this to someone who does not have a lot of spacial areas in their room. It held most of our dvds and it was capable of not breaking. Another thing i like was how sturdy it was! My husband first thought that it could not hold all of our 300+ dvds. But later he realized that it held the maximum capacity and more! This was one of the best buys that i have had from BestBuy yet! If you want something that you can depend on! Than this is your product.</comment>

    <title>Best Marvel Animated Feature to Date</title>
    <comment>Doctor Strange is by far the best Marvel Animated Feature to date. If you enjoyed the previous animated films by Marvel and you are a Marvel fanboy like me, you should pick this up. The animation has seemed to improve as well as the story. Fantastic character arc for Doctor Strange within 83 minutes. Loved the look of the production. The only weak point was the integration of tornado/creatre CGI with 2D animation, whereas the CG cars worked great. Bonus Features are short, but sweet. Always love the Marvel creator segments. If you've played the Video Games you have already seen the cinematics, but still cool to watch whenever you want. Plus a preview of the new Animated Feature "Avengers Reborn" or "Teen Avengers" which will create entirely new Marvel characters.</comment>

    <title>Not the best Season</title>
    <comment>couldn't wait for this to be released, but apparently some of the best shows were in the later seasons. some of these episodes are pretty lame, quite dated and just not very good. Season one had a few memorable episodes, but so far, I am on disk four and haven't found an episode I like yet. And this was one of my favorite shows. I must have missed several of these when it was on broadcast tv, because I don't remember some of them. I know better seasons are coming down the road, but I can't recommend this particular set, just not worth the money. Buy it if you have to have the whole collection, otherwise, I would pass.</comment>

    <title>Amazing sound at this price</title>
    <comment>These entry level procinema series blow away all competition at this price point. The movie sound is crystal clear and powerful. It's designed for movies so the music playing is not as good but still solid. The 8" prosub it comes with packs a tight punch in a small case. For satellite speakers that can be mounted, there's no better sound.</comment>

    <title>Good exp pack but not worth $50</title>
    <comment>I enjoyed playing this game but find I don't dip into it anywhere near as often as I do with GH1 or 2. There are only 30 songs and I really only replay about a third of them. The songs are all fairly easy to learn which is good but it's also a shortcoming as it doesn't make me want to come back to it like the others do. This game should go for around $25-30, that's about all it's worth.</comment>

    <title>Worst Movie Seen</title>
    <comment>This is possibly one of the worst movies that i've seen...i always think positively about movies and try to see the best in every movie that i see, but this movie i kept waiting for a funny part and after an hour, i was sitting there thinking "are you serious?"...the only funny parts were at the end, and there were only about 2 or 3 of them...i HIGHLY recommend that you DO NOT buy this movie...if you dont trust me, go out and rent it first to see what you think of it...</comment>

    <comment>I can't wait for this to come out on DVD, I have loved this show forever and can't wait to share it with friends. This is one of the funniest shows ever! It's like a young version of Seinfeld on crack. Every episode plot is random so don't expect a deep story. Don't forget to watch the new season on Sept 13th!</comment>

    <title>Best series ever. Worst dvd transfers</title>
    <comment>If you haven't seen the series, but like sci-fi even marginally, these are a must-have. I bought seasons 1-4 from Best Buy/.com the first time they went on sale for $20 each. I already had the entire series on VHS, recorded from the original airings... If you can get them on a really good sale, like I did, they are certainly worth owning. Or, if you are watching on a small screen then they are probably worth the price as well. However, on my 109" screen, where most DVDs still look near-HD through my PS3, these seem to be only marginally better than my OLD VHS tapes. Thse are are 5-channel surround, but the rear speakers are way under-utilized. I'm going to have to set up my system special before I finish watching the rest of the series. Otherwise its practially stereo. I did check all first 4 seasons. All have the same terrible transfer quality. I look forward to a Blu-ray release. Most incredible to me is that nobody else online seems to be complaining. Rent one and see for yourself before you drop big money on them.... All that said, I am happy to own them on DVD. A friend can borrow from me, because I can't recommend paying full price.</comment>

    <title>Moonphase is one my most favorite animes ever</title>
    <comment>Moonphase is a really great series with awesome artwork, and great voice actors dubbing it such as Monica Rial, Luci Christian, Sonny Strait, Jason Douglas, and a lot of familar voices you may have heard from familar anime series. This series is cute but at the same time it has its horror moments but mostly comedy. It has vampires, a girl who likes to dress up in cute outfits especially with her cat ears, people who have magical powers, and more. I really enjoyed watching this series and since it has such great animation i bet it would look good in high definition like blu-ray(i hope that comes out soon). If you love vampires, horror, comedy, or something cute well then you should definitely watch this series and check it out.</comment>

    <comment>DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE NOT A FAN OF THE SHOW!!!!!! I think to someone who had never seen the show but saw the movie, this is the stupidest movie ever. Only fans if the show can understand ATHF's unique style of comedy. But who knows? You may find it amusing if you've never seen the show. All I know is that I liked it.</comment>

    <title>Most Amazing Movie Ever</title>
    <comment>I completely loved this movie in every way. It's based off the TV show Firefly. While you need not watch the show before the movie, it still is a great idea. You really get connected with the characters. I drove to Chicago from VA just to see this movie on it's very first showing. Joss Whedon is amazing and so is this movie. If you like SciFi at all you will not be disappointed.</comment>

    <comment>This was my very first Ewan McGregor movie. The story is amazing and the songs are worth every penny. I didn't really like the camera work, but you can get past that easily. The chemistry could not get better between Ewan and Nicole. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a great love story. I promise that the minute Ewan sings "The hills are alive . . ." your heart will melt! You can't beat the music of this movie.</comment>

    <title>Fantastic!</title>
    <comment>With all of the new technologies coming out that utilize your home network, eventually you may need an Ethernet switch to accomodate everything. Well, if you're looking for something that a child can hook up, look no further. I'm telling you, installation could not be easier. With its auto-sensing connectivity, it doesn't matter what port you plug what in. I plugged in a router, a desktop, an Xbox 360, a TiVo, a printer, and a VoIP phone into this switch and everything worked without any issues instantly. Highly recommended!</comment>

    <title>Listen to the Tunes</title>
    <comment>This radio works fine and does what it's supposed to. It's convenient because it comes with a velcro armband so you can strap it to your arm. You can also clip it to a belt. Reception is fairly good, especially on AM stations. I found it to lack a little on FM stations when tuned to transmissions in the gym for watching TV channels. Overall, it's a good value.</comment>

    <title>Best Irish Mafia TV Series EVER!!!</title>
    <comment>Despite being removed from NBC's Monday night lineup for being "too graphic" for television ... The Black Donnelly's rarely uses profain language, so the "whack" scenes are a little more creative than usual to make up for it. The scheming and eventual outcome of this series should have been classic, but unfortunately never got the chance to bloom. If you're a fan of mafia movies, shows, or books ... the Black Donnelly's will not disappoint!</comment>

    <title>Guitar Hero 2 Expansion</title>
    <comment>This product is more of an expansion to Guitar Hero 2 rather than a whole new game. The characters are pretty much the original characters featured on Guitar Hero 1, but with a colorful 80's theme. There are no bonus songs, which really were great in the previous 2 games. Plus, there are way fewer songs in the game, some of them just one hit wonder bands. It would've been nice to see some artists like Metallica, Led Zeppelin, even Hendrix would've been nice. On a more positive note, the gameplay is still fun, including the multiplayer. The single player career is a bit less challenging, but still fun to play songs from a older era of music. This is a great purchase for your PS2 if you need something to interest you until Guitar Hero 3 comes out for the PS2, PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360.</comment>

    <title>The Year Zero is Now</title>
    <comment>This release is one that will last through time as a classic album. The elements that are explored in this album break through to chaotic sounds and smooth melodies with the bass beating strong. This album flows great from start to finish with a nice conceptual sound. Also, the surprise you see when you take the CD out of your CD player is worth the purchase.</comment>

    <title>A Gem In BBC Comedy</title>
    <comment>Before Hugh Laurie was on House M.D and the Stuart Little (1, 2 &amp; 3) movies and before Stephen Fry on Bones and V For Vendetta, and even before the Jeeves &amp; Wooster hit, A Bit Of Fry &amp; Laurie came on the air on the BBC in 1989. I became hooked while watching bits and pieces of the series (a best of) from mt local PBS station, recorded the series that PBS broadcast onto VHS in 1996. As soon as the DVD version hit onto the market, I was able to purchase the entire set at once. There are an inexhaustible characters that both of these actors played in as well as plenty of wordplay in sketch comedy. This is one of the few times you will see Hugh Laurie sit and play the piano, pick up a harmonica or play the guitar and sing a comical tune. This is a true forgotten comedy gem.</comment>

    <comment>I enjoyed the beats in this album, but I perfer his older stuff over this. His newest album (Bobolink Cove) is a really bad album though, stay away from that one, even if you're a fan! If you enjoy Muck Sticky's style, then this one is ok to buy.</comment>

    <title>Good Adventure</title>
    <comment>Although many will spout off "This is heresay" or "Not historical". It is based on the "LEGEND" of early explorers. The film hollywoodizes "Vikings" sure but it still is a very good film with a good story, good action scenes and a good sense of adventure. Don't be put off by naysayers who just don't like ANYTHING these days! In the vein of: "Last of the Mohicans" and "13th Warrior".</comment>

    <title>Mediocre product from a Great band!!!!</title>
    <comment>I was somewhat disappointed when I watched this set. Volume One far exceeds this one in material. Most of the stuff on this one are incomplete shows/interviews, and to make things worse, have been available for years in their entirety. It also claims that it's from 78-95, but in reality it skips 84-87, and 89-90. Due to this omission, there is no mention of the late great Mark St. John except for in the Kommentary, and an Easter egg found on disk 3. The only thing that this set really has going for it, is the Eric Carr material. There's a couple of really good drum solo's (which again have already been made available), a touching kommentary track by Gene &amp; Paul regarding Eric, and at the end of the credits (or should it be kredits?), a great video of Eric in his hospital bed shortly after his heart surgery. He was a trooper and knew how to keep smiling through everything!!!</comment>

    <title>One of the BEST games ever!!</title>
    <comment>I wasn't a big first person shooter fan but I absolutely loved this game. It looks amazing especially in Las Vegas. There are several different gameplay modes to play, including online which is a blast. There's also some good humor in there coming from terrorists when they're panicked. MUST OWN for the 360!</comment>

    <comment>A fantastic, well-crafted comedy that you can watch over and over again. The alternate endings supplied as extras on the DVD are kinda funny, but the original seems most appropriate.</comment>

    <title>What's not to like!</title>
    <comment>David Gilmour famed Lead vocalist &amp; Guitarist of The Pink Floyd really Shines On in this concert dvd. Performing Pink Floyd Classics. Dave even pays homage to founding member Syd Barret by performing a couple of Syds songs, Dominoes never sounded better. Packed with lot's of extras including Comfortably numb performed with Mr Bob Geldolf of the Boom Town Rats( Geldolf also played Pink in the movie the Wall). Rick Wright of the Floyd also makes an appearence for a couple of numbers including one of his solo songs. Excellent concert great sound and visuals especially on a good home entertainment system....Enjoy!</comment>

    <title>Works as Advertised (Two thumbs up)</title>
    <comment>This product is an excellent alternative to having to run wires to the rear speakers across the room from our DVD unit. I have had no problems with any hissing or pops from the unit (We operate 2 laptops, 2 cell phones, and a wireless router in the same room with this unit). It works well, as advertised. I have been very pleased with its performance. I would definitely recommend this product. The only thing take keeps me from rating it with 5 stars is that I would appreciate if the receiving end (the larger piece) was as small and discrete as the transmitting end (the smaller piece).</comment>

    <title>Amazing film-rent before you buy</title>
    <comment>Film Review: This is one of the best movies I saw in 2006. (I think it should have gotten best picture) Great acting. The film really makes you care for the characters and can be very intense at times. This is also a film that does not "spoon-feed" you all the answers and makes you think. Many people didn't like this film because of it, that's why I recommend you rent or watch it on TV before you buy it. Blu-ray Disc Review: Overall it is a great transfer. The audio is great, I even bought the soundtrack after buying and watching the movie. (5/5 for audio). The video is also a great transfer but does not look as good as I would have hoped for. There are a few times where the screen looks grainy but does not effect the overall experience of the film (Video 4/5). Overall- a great film that most people will enjoy. The movie does make you think a bit. Great audio and video. Highly Recommended.</comment>

    <title>Best Blu-ray Disc out there</title>
    <comment>If I could rate this film higher than 5 stars I would. The movie alone is one of the scariest I have ever seen, right under The Exorcist. Very intense, suspenseful movie that not only has it "pop-out" moments, but builds on the atmosphere making it a very scary film throughout. I couldn't have asked for more on the blu-ray disc. It gives you BOTH Unrated Version and the Theatrical Version in High Definition. With 2 terrifying endings. The video is crystal clear. The audio is one of the features that stick out. You can hear everything from deep base sounds, to high screams, to drops of water hitting the inside of the cave. Highly, Highly Recommended. This is my favorite Blu-ray disc (out of the 20 that I have) and couldn't say this anymore but if you are looking at buying one blu-ray movie, Get this one!</comment>

    <title>Great Product</title>
    <comment>I bought this wireless system in August 2007, and have been extremely happy with it. Since I have a wooden floor and cannot hide the rear speaker wires under a carpet, I was looking for such a product for a long time. My biggest concern with other similar products was interference with wireless internet and cordless phones. I must say that I have found absolutely no trace of interference with this system. I have a 24/7 wireless internet at my home, along with a 5.8 GHz cordless phone. I have tried using both these while using the wireless system, and there's been zero interference. Two other things stood out: (1) You only need one of these for both rear speakers - the system encodes both channels on the same wireless signal and then decodes them separately at the receiver (2) The amplifier in the receiver unit adds extra power for your rear speakers. GREAT BUY!</comment>

    <title>Best Sounding Speakers for outdoors</title>
    <comment>I need some out door speakers that would have good sound, and so I found these. I got to say there is a sence of presences with these speakers out doors. I love holding backyard party's and my guest just love them. I have the speakers hidden behind some large bushes that are in my backyard so it would not take away from the sence of presences. So my guest allways ask me where that wonderful sound is coming from so then I show them and they can't believe there eyes. I recomend these to any one.</comment>

    <title>Not what expected but still awesome</title>
    <comment>This is a great game as it is not one that you sit on a couch with a little controller exercising only your thumbs. I have played all three of the current Guitar Hero games, and this one dissapointed me because there is not as many songs and unlockables as I feel there should have been. However i am a fan of Guitar Hero games so I would recommend this game to anyone that likes the Guitar Hero series</comment>

    <title>Disturbia</title>
    <comment>After all of the great word-of-mouth on the thriller Disturbia, that made me want to check it out even more. Going into it, I really didn't know what to expect &amp; was very pleased by the time the credits started rolling. Disturbia stars up-and-comer Shia LaBeouf (TV's Even Stevens &amp; the upcoming Transformers movie), Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix trilogy &amp; Memento), David Morse (The Green Mile &amp; TV's Hack), and newcomers Sarah Roemer (The Grudge 2) &amp; Aaron Yoo (TV's The Bedford Diaries). The whole cast here is excellent, but it is LaBeouf &amp; Roemer who obviously steal the spotlight from everyone else. The chemistry that builds up between those two is great. You really get attached to these characters &amp; really want to see them take down the killer. All in all, Disturbia is very well written &amp; the surprise hit that many should check out.</comment>

    <title>Hot Fuzz</title>
    <comment>I can't believe it has been almost 3 years since director Edgar Wright's &amp; screenwriter/actor Simon Pegg's zombie spoof Shaun of the Dead became a surprise hit. Wright returns here with Simon Pegg &amp; Nick Frost (the great duo from Shaun of the Dead) in the action spoof Hot Fuzz. Wright pays homage to such blockbuster action flicks like the Die Hard movies, the Leathal Weapon movies the Bad Boys movies,and a handful of other buddy cop flicks. Hot Fuzz combines both the action &amp; grit of those movies to go along with the awesome British humor that Shaun of the Dead brought to the table. As expected, the jokes here are top-notch, the action scenes are surprisingly well done, the comedic timing is perfect &amp; the chemistry between Pegg &amp; Frost is priceless once again. The supporting cast is put together very well. It includes the likes of Jim Broadbent (Moulin Rouge, Iris &amp; Gangs of New York), Timothy Dalton (Licence to Kill &amp; The Rocketeer), Bill Nighy (Love Actually &amp; Underworld) and some other great British actors &amp; actresses. All in all, Hot Fuzz is a must-see for everyone that loved Shaun of the Dead.</comment>

    <title>Awesome Bleach DVD</title>
    <comment>I own all five volumes of Bleach so far, and watch it on tv faithfully. This particular volume has some wicked firsts: Ichigo with a Hollow mask as well as the personifcation of Zangetsu. There's the added bonus of a very nice trading card inside the clamshell cover. The only thing I didn't like about this volume is that Renji is on the cover.</comment>

    <title>A good Buy</title>
    <comment>Great Item and a good buy for the price. I bought two and they worked well and they were easy to install. The heat pads make it better so they don't overheat. This ram works fine on PC2 computers and this will work on a computer running a PC2-4200 but the computer will always run at the lower number. (e.g. If you have a 5300 and a 4200 both will run at 4200) A great buy!</comment>

    <title>Loved this movie</title>
    <comment>I loved this movie. The artwork was fantastic and the story line was excellent. It told the story of Doctor Strange from the beginning till he became Sorcerer Supreme of Earth and his conflict with Mordo and the Demon. The graphics on Blu-Ray are fantastic and the price for the movie was real reasonable.</comment>

    <title>Best speakers for the price!</title>
    <comment>I've purchased a bunch of the cheaper $20-40 speakers in the past for my desktop, even a couple of the 5.1 Surround sets that are only like $100. These speakers blow them outta the water! Bose excellence at its finest here! Great bass, spacial sound, clear as day. I'm reconsidering my Onyko surround system at my house for a Bose system now. I don't know how they pack that sound into these little speakers.</comment>

    <comment>The 5th season of SMALLVILLE was one of the better ones -it covered the coming of Brainiac as well as Lex's political aspirations and the monumental 100th episode of the series too. A great 6 disc set that has every episode as well as several great extras.</comment>

    <comment>We've only been using this keyboard for 4 days, but I am very pleased with it. I can rest my palms and use my fingers with the minimum of movement. I was getting achy fingers with my conventional board before, but it has stopped now with this ergonomic version. I note the other comment about the unreliability. Let's hope this does not happen to us! I'm learning to touch type on it, and find it really useful for that purpose. I want to give this 4 stars, but it will not let me give more than 3!!</comment>

    <title>The 2nd Definitive HAMLET...For Now.</title>
    <comment>Ever since "The Tragicall Historie Of Hamlet, Prince Of Denmarke" by William Shakespeare was first performed in 1600 at the Globe Theater in London, there have been countless film versions of the classic tragedy of murder, family loyalty, corruption, love and revenge. But, never has it been told like this...until now. For the first time, William Shakespeare's greatest work is presented in its entirety on film by accomplished Shakespearean director, actor, writer &amp; producer Kenneth Branagh ("Henry V," Dead Again," "Much Ado About Nothing," "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"). The film is a masterpiece of filmmaking. At 242 minutes, it is certainly not for those with short attention spans or for those who do not enjoy Shakespeare. The film presents a lot of subleties which are lost in other film interpretations. Shakespeare would be proud. The movie includes a fascinating featurette on the making of the film. The movie also includes an informative introduction by director/star Kenneth Branagh. Rated PG for some violence.</comment>

    <title>Solty Rei has a lot of action</title>
    <comment>Solty Rei has a great soundtrack to it, great voice acting, and a great story behind it. There is a lot of action scenes in it and when you put it on 5.1 surround sound on any tv set the explosions sound like they are real and happening next to you because it has such a loud boom sound whenever something explodes. Plus here on this website you get the starter set for only $16 plus tax and shipping but thats a really great price for the starter set for a great anime. It kind of has that Cowboy Bebop feel to it except they are not on a space ship and no blues music but other than that it did kind of remind me in a way of Cowboy Bebop in some parts of the series. It also has comedy and drama. Highly recommended i give it a 10 out of 10 just because its such a great anime.</comment>

    <title>Not Recomended</title>
    <comment>I've used several different keyboards in my life working in the software industry. I have carpel tunnel syndrome, and am always on the lookout for a good ergonomic keyboard. I've used two of these keyboards (first one didn't work right out of the box, and the second one's keys where terribly unresponsive). Below are my pros and cons from my experience w/ this keyboard: Pros: Programmable keys; palm rest; added keys near the number pad such as the '(' and ')' keys Cons: All characters are stickers and not painted directly on the keys; key strokes do not provide distinctive feedback; keys had a very smooth surface, which made it hard to find your place at times [i.e. the F &amp; J indicators where not very apparent); very large in size</comment>

    <title>Good Game to Play With Friends</title>
    <comment>I think that this Mario Party was one of the best ones created. The minigames were really fun for a short time. The boards were pretty fun to play on. Although it was a fairly east game to play I would still recommend this game to my friends. One of my friends who owns the game doesn't complain about the game. He thinks it is an OK game. I hope if you buy this game you would recommend your friends. I hope there are many more Mario Party games to come. :)</comment>

    <title>Elvis Lives</title>
    <comment>Watched the show on Channel 28. They have done a wonderful job with the groups that played with Elvis and then put in Elvis singing. So nice to see the same people and how they look now. Wonderful job. As an Elvis fan I really enjoyed reminiscing and hearing his music. He sang such wonderful Gospel music besides all his rock and roll songs. There will never be another Elvis!!!!!!</comment>

    <title>No definition, distorted sound, feeling ripped off</title>
    <comment>Out of the box, these speakers look funny, but the looks grow on you. The design seems solid, but the build quality feels sub-par for a brand which carries such a following. They sound alright, but there is no definition in the sound. If you get these speakers, plan to use them with a subwoofer if you want to feel the music, or be in the movie. I tried first without a subwoofer, and almost all the music in my library sounded anemic. Added my cheap Yamaha subwoofer to the mix, and it got marginally better. I don't know if I just got a bad set, but when you turn the volume up when your favorite song comes on, or your favorite scene comes up in a movie, the 161's started to distort very badly, almost like the drivers inside were blown. I didn't turn the volume to Maximum, and before halfway, they began terribly distorting the music I was listening to. I tried adjusting everything I knew to adjust and nothing helped. I wound up returning the Bose 161's and left with a set of Klipsch Quintets. SO far, I am very pleased with these.</comment>

    <title>Works well</title>
    <comment>The Sirius car kit works well for what it is. Due to its size it can be placed in many different locations and looks nice with the receiver attached. It was very hard to find for a while when I wanted to buy an additional car kit for another vehicle. I was able to finally find it though.</comment>

    <title>saves on battery and great grip</title>
    <comment>Bought this so I could save on AA's but the grips that come with it truly help you keep hold of the controller. It would be nice if when putting in charger, it "clicked" in to place. You sometimes have to wiggle it a bit to keep the strap from blocking the charging point. Easy to use and set up. The charge seems to last a while. Would have been nice to have a quad charger.</comment>

    <title>This Ram is Insane!!!</title>
    <comment>This ram is crazy! I mean like totally flipped-out, wiggy, whack-a-mole spank-tacular!!!! There's ram, and then there's this stuff. I could go on all day about this ram. It's hard to express how superbalicious this ram is. The first time I used this ram. I was addicted. There's no words to describe the shear ecstacy that I derive while surfing the information super highway atop a waxed down shimmering goddess of a surfboard like these sticks of ram can surly be. Just stick them in each a slot and BAM! You've got a spicy italian hitman chasing you down the back alleys of Fun-city, across the slopes of Memory-mountain and deep into the forbidden stretches of the uber-data-speed-zone baby!!!!</comment>

    <title>CENSORED VERSION</title>
    <comment>This particular version SUCKS!!! It is the "clean" g-rated version of the movie. The famous full frontal nude scene of Don Johnson's is COMPLETELY EDITED OUT and let's face it, the nudity is the ONLY reason to watch this otherwise stupid movie. Without it, FORGET IT!! Don't waste your time.</comment>

    <title>My new favorite movie!</title>
    <comment>I just watched this movie the other day, and I was blown away. Gackt Camui (Sho) and Hideto "Hyde" Takarai (Kei) are well known Japanese Rock singers, so I had pretty much expected the movie to be something just the fans could enjoy. I was way off. The movie has action, drama, vampires, themes of friendship, and more. There were moments when I was excited, laughing, and even crying. I feel this is a movie that can appeal to people of all different tastes. If my review doesn't convince you that this movie is worth seeing, see it anyway and try to prove me wrong. I leave you with this, a lyric from the movie's theme song, Orenji no Taiyou (The Orange Sun), which I feel sums up the entire movie. "All the joys and sadness, the countless encounters and partings, just as it did back then, the orange sun oversees them all." - written and performed by Gackt &amp; Hyde</comment>

    <title>These memories do their jobs. Rating: A</title>
    <comment>These memories give a power to your computer to work faster as well as enhancing gaming experience. If you have the motherboard which supports Dual Channel Memory, you better buy 2 x 1GB rather than 1 x 2GB to enable the Dual Channel function. These memories also run with cool temperature due to the built-in heat spreader. This is a BestBuy after all.</comment>

    <title>wow, fast</title>
    <comment>This installed no problem on windows vista ultimate. At the point at which the disk prompted me to put the device in the usb the computer detected it and asked if I would like it installed automatically. It then took over the installation process from the provided disk and it has worked ever since. Originally I used this with my old linksys router (not N) and it was backwards compatable as described in the ad. I would recomend this product without hesitation.</comment>

    <comment>This is a wonderful video. It's a documentary account of the making of the Yield album, with interviews as well as music. Gives you a much closer insight to what was going on with the band at the time, from each member's perspective. I have watched it over and over again, and never get tired of it. BUY IT</comment>

    <title>Rocketfish Works Kinda</title>
    <comment>I purchased the Rocketfish along with a 5 piece Klipsch speaker system. The rocketfish needs to be manually turned on/off in the front every time you want to use the system otherwise the speakers will hum when the receiver is turned off. I found too much hum in general. I returned the unit. Best Buy refunded my money with no problems!</comment>

    <comment>This movie is a great way to wrap up a show that should still be on TV. Firefly was a great show. It was better that a lot of the junk that is still on TV now. My advice is to watch the Firefly TV shows first and then the movie so you know who the characters are, plus the show is excellent to boot.</comment>

    <title>Not much of Italy</title>
    <comment>Discover Italy is not really discovering ITALY itself but this Blu-Ray Disc is basic story about several people in different parts of the Italian Peninsula and Sicily. Yes the nice HDTV shows some of the nice scenic background but. I did wish I was able to see ITALY itself as if I was a Tourist sight seeing in that country. It was ok but I was a bit disappointed in this.</comment>

    <title>Tom Clancy's cleans up our sin city</title>
    <comment>Finally a strong multiplayer for the Xbox360. I would recommend this game as a must have for the console. Sure GRAW has the stronger single player story. But RSV delivers with the online multiplayer. Customize characters (even putting your own picture with the Xbox Vision Cam). Smooth gameplay, Great graphics (which looks better in HD) and plenty of modes to enjoy for a long time. The only thing that RSV lacks is inviting a guests online for more gameplay.</comment>

    <comment>All of these songs were in the movie and they were fabulous! Michael Bay always has the best music with his movies and this is reminiscent of Miami Vice. The movie was terrific, but the soundtrack gave it that much extra! Absolutely loved it...</comment>

    <title>Sweet and Funny</title>
    <comment>The movie is a humerous look at modern romance. The main character reminds us to follow our hearts not the current trends.</comment>

    <title>-Worth Every Minute.-</title>
    <comment>I've been watching Bleach now for a very long time. Since the very first episode all the way to last created episode of 136, which is the beginning of the 3rd and last part of the Bleach series. Even if I already have seen these episodes on each DVD released, I will continue to buy them for the sheer quality of each episode, which much better than watching it anywhere else. The only disappointing thing is that it takes almost an entire month for each DVD to be released, but the DVD is well worth waiting for. I can just imagine the hard work put into each one. Ive just happened to read the last post on here, about it being disappointing that Renji is on the cover. I have to disagree. Wait till you watch more into Bleach, you will be glad that Renji is on the cover. :P</comment>

    <title>Talib's best album to date...</title>
    <comment>If you're a fan of Talib's, you've probably heard this album already. If you're a fan of Talib's and you haven't heard this album already, you NEEEEED to pick it up tomorrow. It's clearly Talib's most solid effort to date. He's slowed up his flow a bit and actually rhymes ON BEAT for a good portion of the album (hehe). ;-) I know it get's trivial when certain artists perform together too often...but I would've really have like to seen Mos Def make an appearance. Any tease for another Black Star album is welcome. I don't know if Talib will ever hit "platinum, superstar" status but he is TRULY one of the best 'new age' emcees.</comment>

    <title>Real Styles P</title>
    <comment>this album is great for real fans of styles p and his mixtapes. This album is more hardcore, real thoughts from styles. Closer to a return to his 1st album, A Gangster And A gentleman. This album was different than his more commercial album, Time Is Money. This is the styles p i have enjoyed listening to since the first LOX album. STyles proves on this album that he hasnt conformed to industry standards and can still deliver music from the heart and also hardcore lyrics.</comment>

    <title>Wish I could give it Zero Stars</title>
    <comment>Well I had to take some time out of my life just to recommend to never think about getting this film. Many factors in bad film making come into The Hills Have Eyes 2. But one of my main factors is when one of the so called military personal in training gets shots buy his own gun and tells his co-trainer "It's okay it did not hit the bone". That alone almost made me get up and leave the theatre. The only thing keeping me there was the fact I paid $8.50 for a ticket...</comment>

    <title>Worst game ever</title>
    <comment>This game was the most disappointing purchase i made for the PS3 todate. The camera angles and interactive items where verry jerky and almost worthy of a 16 bit system. All of the people you fight look exactly the same, monotonus if you will. Bottom line is that this game is not fun.</comment>

    <title>Best sub $1000 satellite system</title>
    <comment>This speaker system shines right out of the box. It handles dynamic movie soundtracks very well, and yet at the same time has a perfect music tonality. The sound it not too bright, and is very warm when listening to multi chanel audio such as DVD Aduio and SACD. I would highly recommend purchasing this speaker system to anybody that wants a great sounding all in one speaker system, made by Def Tech. Other systems demoed: Polk Audio sub/sats Yamaha Infinity</comment>

    <title>A fairly Decent Title.</title>
    <comment>I will grade this anime on four categories including: animation, story, music, and enjoyment. Animation -- 7/10 -- The animation is average. The surroundings can seem plain and underdone. The character designs are unique but are inconsistent at times. Story -- 8/10 -- The story is pretty interesting. An incident happens at the main characters hometown when they were children. A mass murder occurs and the main characters parents are killed. Flash forward 10 years and the main character is joining the police force to solve the case. He is unaware on the complexity of the incident and gets sucked in to something bigger. The story is interesting but draws similarities to Bleach and other supernatural Animes. Music -- 6/10 -- The music is a standard fare. A little to upbeat for a horror type anime. You will see yourself skipping throughout the ending song. The opening is pretty catchy and quite enjoyable. Enjoyment -- 8/10-- Despite its flaws the anime is quite enjoyable. The first volume paces the anime well towards addiction.</comment>

    <title>AT LAST!!! The Original Popeye Cartoons on DVD</title>
    <comment>At long last, Warner Brothers has finally released the first 60 Popeye cartoon shorts on DVD. These are all fully restored from the original negatives, and both the picture and sound quality are tremendous! And the animation is incredible! For those not familiar with the history of the Popeye cartoons, this first release on 4 DVDs features the splendid black-and-white shorts from the Max Fleischer Studios. Much care was taken by Max, his brother Dave, and the animators back in the 1930s. Some of the backdrops have a 3-D look. Popeye was voiced first by William Costello until sometime in 1935, and then Jack Mercer took over. Especially then did the Sailor Man start his great, funny muttering. The deep-voiced Gus Wickie was also marvelous as the voice of his rival Bluto. Wickie took over that job from 1935 until his death, sadly, in 1938. The stories are all entertaining and often quite funny. The extras are informative and enjoyable as well. Many of us remember watching Popeye cartoons as a kid, but might only remember the later color Popeye shorts from the 50s and 60s. Those were not as good as these original cartoons from the 30s. If you really like Popeye, you will surely love these vintage Fleischer Studios Popeye cartoons. Highly recommended!</comment>

    <title>Amazing</title>
    <comment>This movie was done to as a close out for all of the fans of Firefly (which if you ask me should never been taken off...but w/e). While it is true that if you watch the series the movie will be deeper, that does not mean that you need to watch the series before the movie. The movie is amazing in it's own, and I suggest that you try it out. Heck, if you like it enough, you can get the series.......</comment>

    <title>Terrible Technical Support - Do Not Buy D-Link</title>
    <comment>D-Link used to be helpful, but I replaced my Belkin router with a D-Link since it was on sale and my Belkin stopped working. I have a network printer, attached via ethernet cable and it was not being seen on the network through the router. When I called tech support they said the line was only for connection issues with the router to the internet modem and would not support me. They urged that I conveniently call their PAY support line. This is ridiculous. I am taking the router back to Best Buy tomorrow.</comment>

    <title>Loved It!!! Shame on Network for canceling</title>
    <comment>Ok I started watching DA from the pilot episode was loved it. Then I would faithfully record it each week and watch it after work/ The write was awesome on 1st season and what can I say Jessica Alba was HOTTTTTT. I prefer her with the black hair but hey anyways I hated to see these show get yanked even though it did seem the writers were stretching it on season 2.</comment>

    <title>Better than I had expected...</title>
    <comment>I bought this not really expecting anything life-alteringly serious, I pretty much thought it'd be a fun little fluffy workout that wouldn't involve much in the way of strenuous exercise, but I was WRONG. This dvd set is great, and it's a great deal. While the workouts don't look all that tricky, they definitely do the job and make you sweat. And the perky supermodels are annoying to listen to and not incredibly informative, so I'd opt for the Trainer Commentary under special features instead, that way you get technical advice and are less likely to hurt yourself. All in all I think it's a great deal, nicely filmed, and will definitely burn some calories!</comment>

    <title>Great Show!</title>
    <comment>As someone who watches little to no television, this show actually held my interest. Of course, I can never seem to catch it when it's aired, and so the DVD is perfect for me. While each show can stand on it's own, easily, there is an ongoing plot that is hard to follow when you only see 5 episodes per season on the original air date. This show really is something, and in case you didn't know, Hugh Laurie (the actor that plays Greg House) is a British actor, and is doing an "American" accent for the role of House. THAT's acting!</comment>

    <title>I love this guy!</title>
    <comment>I was introduced to Peter Murphy (his music, not himself) in the spring of 2006. I haven't been able to get enough since then. He's got a huge catalog, and this CD is an excellent way to get a lot of his (poppier) great songs! Although, I can't seem to find any of his CD's here in Michigan Best Buy stores... Such a shame. I wouldn't even know what genre to place this album, but as the vocalist from the band Bauhaus, Peter is often called the "Godfather of Goth" I wouldn't use that label on this compilation. He's got amazing tone, an admirable range, and best of all, very interesting song arrangements. If you find yourself at a club that happens to play, uhh... "alternative" music, request something like The Sweetest Drop and see if you can stay still!</comment>

    <title>The lovable Serial Killer</title>
    <comment>I began watching this series on showtime when it orginally aired last september just on a whim. After the second episode I was completely drawn in. Michael C. Hall does an amazing job of playing Dexter, a cold emotionless Sociopath. It is really hard to talk much about the series without giving spoilers, but it is well worth watching. My girlfriend and I have very different tastes in our television watching and it is nearly impossible to find anything we can both agree on. She likes law and order and I like anything Horror related . This show did the trick for us . It had all the elements of a great crime drama, but with enough elements of a horror movie to keep me entertained. The series stays very near to Jeff Lindsay's book Darkly Dreaming Dexter which is a must read as well. In the first season we are introduced to Dexter and His step sister Deb. Both work for the Miami police Department. Throughout the series we see Dexter struggle with his inablilty to show any true emotions for anyone including his girlfriend Rita. He has to try to fit in to cover his tracks. Dexter Is the good guy serial killer, Killing only those who have somehow escaped Justice, and most tactfully too. But it would appear He has met his match The ice trick killer . On a trail of leads the department is trying to track down this murderer , but they keep hitting speed bumps. Dexter is first obsessed with catching the killer himself. But then slowly becomes entranced with the precision of the Ice Truck killer, and wants to "play with him" . Unfolding many secrets about Dexters Past along the way He begins to wonder if there is a connection between them. The web unfolds and Dexter encounters a new series of struggles... it keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way to the very end!</comment>

    <title>I can't believe I found it!!</title>
    <comment>Ok, I was like 7 when this movie was released in '86. I really don't know if it was in the theaters for very long. I first saw it on HBO (when there was only one HBO channel). I videotaped it &amp; watched it constantly!! The videotape has been ruined, so I couldn't believe it when I found the movie again. Many people may not be into an old cheesy movie like this. But, if you are into old cheesy movies from the 80's, I would recommend it.</comment>

    <title>The Orignal SciFi Horror!</title>
    <comment>The orignal Sci-Fi horror film that started it all! If you've never had a chance to see the original Alien film now's the time. At 10 bucks its a steal. They don't make them like they used to! The movie may not be as scary as it used to be but it still beats out all of today's straight to video scifi-horror flicks by a long shot!</comment>

    <comment>While not as scary as the original, and more of an action movie than straight scifi horror, this one manages to be even better than the orignal! With an all star cast and nonstop action you can't afford to pass this one up for 10 bucks! Easliy the best of the alien series</comment>

    <title>Not the Movie for Everyone</title>
    <comment>Murder Set Pieces is now labled as the most notorious horror movie of all time within the hardened horror community, it superseeds the masagenistic violence and gore that was seen in other movies like Maniac or Texas Chainsaw. On the other hand it is worth seening and i strongly recommend it only to THOSE WHO SEEK MOVIE GORE and not a normal horror fan or average movie goer. After watching the movie and listening to the commentary I realized that there was another version of the movie, i.e. the real Theatrical release of the movie rather then the one sold at Best Buy which has been toned down for the average horror fan, ironically there are scenes in the bestbuy version that are unqiue to it therefore for any collector it is still a must have. At the very least the movie is worth seeing due to the fact that it is reminicent of the 70s midnight grindhouse horror shows. Thanks for reading the review!</comment>

    <title>Finally what we were waiting for!</title>
    <comment>ROTS is everything we were waiting for when Lucas announced he was doing prequals. Non stop Star Wars action! Weak acting and dialogue but the spectular ending more than makes up for it. This move makes the first two prequals unecessary.</comment>

    <comment>Only absolute die hard fans would give this moive a descent review. A desent movie on its own, but a disaster when compared to the originals. More intended for children then adults. Just buy ROTS and skip this one.</comment>

    <title>Great Features with a few glitches</title>
    <comment>This product has some great features, such as the ability to input artist names or CD titles using a standard keyboard as well as the remote (figure on buying a cheap keyboard - it's much easier). If you record your own CDs you can write a text file to the CD that the player will read (NEAT) and display the artist and CD title. Also allows you to group your CDs by type (country, rock, etc.), Sometimes gets "confused" when in random play mode (you must shut off and turn back on). Other than that, a great addition to your audio arsenal.</comment>

    <title>Horror Flick, Yet Documentary</title>
    <comment>The Manson Family is a strange yet effective documentary of the supposed "personal" accounts of the members of Charlie's family. In reality it is similar to the movie Natural Born Killers in that it is based around a journalist doing a report on the manson family in present day, using the former members of the family to tell the story. Therefore the movie is presented in interview scences along with flashbacks of the events where a correct account of what actually happened in comparison to what the interviewies are saying. This movie is worht the time and money for several reasons; one it is a decent gorefest for those who seek that, two it provides correct information about the manson family and the events they participated in, third it is a extremely unique way of showing a documentary, fourth and finally is the special feature on the second disk, which is an actual interview with the man himself Charles Manson which shows some of the deranged charisma he has. Overall this is a recommended movie in my book. Thanks for reading the review!</comment>

    <title>Good action but little else!</title>
    <comment>Still no acting and even worse dialogue. Can Lucas even write a script anymore?! Action sequences are all you will get out of this one. Just Watch the last 45 min or so, or skip it altogether and buy ROTS.</comment>

    <title>It works</title>
    <comment>Wanted a surge suppresor for my A/V equipment that looked nice and the on/off switch was easily accessable. It looks great with the system. It does filter the power. Before, I would run the vacuum cleaner and lines would appear on the TV and noise would come through the speakers. I put in the panamax and the lines and the noise totally disappeared. And i don't have to reach behind the shelf to turn off the old surge supressor. I can just hit a button in the front.</comment>

    <comment>This dvd here is very comical and very hilarious, the dvd uncut box starter set comes with a locker of school Rumble that lets you insert the following DVD's releasing in months, a year book with the characters of the anime. I recommend this DVD series due to the fact that if anyone wants a great laugh, good time, or need cheering up it works.</comment>

    <comment>I saw this movie in theaters and absolutely loved it. Lindsay Lohan may be a disaster in real life but she did an amazing job playing "Rachel" in this movie. Never a dull moment and im sure alot of teens out there could relate to this movie. Enough comedy that even mom and grandma would appreicate and relate also. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>How noble in reason</title>
    <comment>While frequently touted as the first unabridged screen version of the Bard's classic (and arguably, definitive) tragedy, true fans will notice the addition of a single word, and the change of another... However, shot in gorgeous 65mm film amidst stunning visual scenery, few other shortcomings can be found for this piece. The audience, entering Branagh's world with wonder and more than a little trepidation, are left exactly as this reviewer: speechless.</comment>

    <title>This bag is HUGE!</title>
    <comment>I started a new job and received a laptop computer to use. I had a messenger bag that I used for 10+ years when I had a job that didn't require me to carry a laptop around with me. I have an actual laptop bag (also 10+ years old) that I used for the first couple of days, in addition to bringing along my messenger bag. After a couple of days, I thought that I really needed something that I could carry both my personal items and my laptop in. I went on the website and found this bag - granted, my laptop does not have a 17" screen, but I thought that I'd buy a little bigger bag so that I had a good amount of storage space. Not only can this bag handle my laptop, and the normal items that I usually carry around with me, but it can handle quite a bit more than I'll probably use it for. There are a lot of areas for storing smaller items (CD's, cell phones, MP3 players, etc), and it even has a drink holder and a separate cell phone holder. Needless to say, I think that I'll be using this bag for quite awhile.</comment>

    <title>Well worth it</title>
    <comment>School Rumble is a romantic comedy about a group of high school students and their daily lives. The series main character, Tenma Tsukamoto, is a second year student at Yagami High School. She has an enormous crush on a boy in her class named Oji Karasuma, who is totally oblivious of Tenma's feeling towards him. The story gets complicated when we discover Kenji Harmina, the resident high school delinquent and male protagonist, has a crush on Tenma. Like Tenma, Kenji also finds it hard to confess his feelings to his crush. Whenever Kenji and Tenma try to confess to their crushes a situation in the episode always arises that prevents them from say those three words. As the series progresses other relationships develop often creating a love triangle or even a love square. PLOT: School Rumble is a typical high school romantic comedy. The thing that sets this series apart from the rest of the pack are the extremely lovable characters and the multiple love triangles and squares. It seem everybody is in love with everybody which in turn causes some utterly hilarious situations. Even though Tenma and Kenji continuously fail to confess their love to their crushes the series does not seem to drag on because of the multiple sub romances and hilarious moments that occur pretty much every seen. The awesome thing about School Rumble is that the viewers often have been in some of the same situations as the characters. While watching this series, there were several times when I said 'Wow, that happened to me senior year' and so on. ANIMATION: The animation in School Rumble is one of the things that makes this series so funny. From the expressions on the character's faces during embarrassing moments to the Tenma's two pig tails that wiggle up and down. The scenes in School Rumble will always put on smile on your face. The artists and animators did a superb job making this incredibly funny manga come alive onscreen. ARTWORK: The characters and their surroundings were all beautifully drawn in this series. The design of the characters fit their roles perfectly.This series is full of beautiful high school girls that are very pleasing to the eye. Its a shame that there isn't that much fan-servicein this series. CHARACTERS: The characters make this series what it is. Sure some of the characters are cliche...but they are all lovable characters. The two main characters, Tenma and Kenji are the type of characters that you can't help but feel sorry far making you love them that much more. Each character develops quite nicely throughout the series. They learn about what it is to be a teenager, being in love and how to overcome things that get them down or hold them back. The really great thing about the characters in School rumble is that everyone can relate to at least one of the characters, if not all of them. MUSIC &amp; SOUND EFFECTS: School Rumble's music and sound effects fit really well with the series. It often made a moment 3x more hilarious. The opening and ending themes seem to be made exclusively for this series...or do it feels like.</comment>

    <title>Worst carpet cleaner EVER</title>
    <comment>I had a Hoover Carpet cleaner for years. Was time to replace it and get one that would scrub. I wasn't excited about paying $300.00 but had been happy with my last Hoover. Within a month or so I realized this was the biggest piece of junk I had ever purchased. The plastic pieces kept breaking and falling off. The handle on the bottom tank broke, the lever for the height adjustment broke. the plugs from the upper tank broke. This is only within the first month or so. After dealing with this for about a year I broke down and purchassed the cheaper unit for under $200.00. The cheaper one is much like the unit I used for years. I am much happier with the new purchase.</comment>

    <title>great collection</title>
    <comment>I first got this on tape. After hearing this version of the weight w/Marty Stewart and the Staple Singers I got goose bumps. This is the best cover version I have ever heard. A Rainy Night In Georgia is also a great cover version. The teaming of these artists was just a great idea. The album as a whole is just wonderful.</comment>

    <title>Jaws is great</title>
    <comment>But this is not even in the same league. I even still like Jaws 3 (which I liked as a kid) but this is probably the reason most movies don't go past a third sequel. It even has a shark making dinosaur type roars as it's "in pain."</comment>

    <title>Worse that Office for Apple</title>
    <comment>I purchased this suite with a new pc and hated it from the first day. Too many tabs, too many bells and whistles. They had it right with Office 2003 but I have no idea what they were thinking with this mess. The only thing that comes to mind is the Office suite for Apple on bad steroids. I took it off and went back to 2003. I only wish I had my money back. I have used Microsoft Office since it's conception. This version is a miscarriage.</comment>

    <title>worth buying again</title>
    <comment>This show was cancelled way too soon. This show is nothing like you've ever seen. This family of outcasts are people you can relate to. Buy the complete series "Firefly" and get this also. This show is that good! The features on this new release lets you into the world of the crew of Serenity, walk where they walked...Awesome!!!</comment>

    <title>Great Comfort from a Controller</title>
    <comment>Microsoft designed an ergonomic controller for optimum comfort and aesthetics. The controller syncs seamlessly to your 360 and you can power the console on and off with the controller as well. I definitely recommend the Play &amp; Charge kit so you don't have to use disposable batteries and waste your money on them. I still don't understand why Sony keeps the same awkward and aging controller with their PS3. Overall this is the best controller available for any gaming console.</comment>

    <title>Great tv stand all around</title>
    <comment>After shopping around, we decided on this tv stand. We bought a 46" Samsung LCD tv and this stand goes perfectly with it. The glossy black finish gives it a nice look. It is easy to put together it just takes a little while. It is very sturdy. The only con is that it collects dust very easily so it's hard to keep clean.</comment>

    <title>Good quality, reliable</title>
    <comment>I bought the Rocketfish(TM) Universal Wireless Rear Speaker Kit to hook up my Samsung rear speakers. It was $30 cheaper than the Samsung wireless kit and seems to work perfectly. It was easy to setup, and worked right away...I only had to increase the volume on the rear unit during setup so that it matched the other speakers. It now remains on so I don't have to touch it at all. I sometimes hear a small pop when I switch channels, but that could just be the speakers themselves. I have had no problems with buzzing or any other annoyance, and I use it with wireless internet, and 5.8ghz phone at the same time. Glad I bought this.</comment>

    <title>Rent It First</title>
    <comment>I got this game the first week it came out. Worst mistake ever not to rent it. It was fun at first but after you have played all the mini games, It got really boring. If they had more mini games I would give this game a 4 or a 5. But the good things about this game are the coarses, and the 2 new charaters (you have to unlcok them). I would rent this game before you buy it.</comment>

    <title>Save your money</title>
    <comment>After playing Oblivion for 300+ hours, i was so looking forward to this game coming out. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! Lousy graphics, HORRIBLE DIALOGUE!! Terrible interface and controls!! If you must, rent this game -- but save your money for something else. In fact, I bought Bioshock while I was waiting for this game to come out -- and that game rocks!! This game is just a pile of rocks....</comment>

    <title>Worth Every Penny</title>
    <comment>Sound quality is fantastic and for half the cost of the Bose Sound Dock. I have tested all types of music with this unit and have yet to find one that does not sound great. I have owned Klipsch home speakers and have always been impressed by their sound quality. Klipsch did not disappoint with the SXT Sound System.</comment>

    <title>Buyer beware... wait for GH3</title>
    <comment>This game was a big let down for the GH series. I don't think a game has ever released a game later in the series and decided to remove characters and features that were hits in previous titles. I purchased this game for $40 and received a $15 gift card. I tell myself it was worth the $25, but I only believe that because I wanted new songs to play. As for anyone wanting to shell out $50 for this game, I'd say wait for GH3</comment>

    <title>Best Action Anime Ever</title>
    <comment>Dragonball Z is one the best action packed series that will keep you watching it over and over especially with its uncut action that they have never shown on T.V. The marathon selection is another great thing about it with only the first opening theme showing and the rest of the episodes. Also without the saying of "Last time on Dragonball Z" and previews of the next episode. To the end with only the ending theme last and comes with 39 episodes of the Vegeta Saga.</comment>

    <title>Awesome!</title>
    <comment>All of the excellent reviews of the movie and the show are true! I'm a late-20s girl who loves watching American Idol, Laguna Beach, Dancing With the Stars, etc. but Firefly is my favorite show ever! It's that good. If you watch the movie without watching the show first (which is what I did), you'll be like, "That was a pretty good movie". If you watch the show first and then watch the movie, you'll be like "WOW!!! Awesome!!!" If you watch the very first episode on the DVD box set (it's a two-part episode), you will be hooked. At least give it a try. =)</comment>

    <title>Why Dance?</title>
    <comment>San Francisco Bay Area filmmaker James E. Manning and co-producer Shely Pack have created an extraordinary look into what inspires kids to pursue the fantastical world of dance and why it can drive some parents totally nuts. Why Dance is a simple question that gets answered in simple cinematic terms. Focusing on the subject of Ballet, Manning aims his camera straight at the creators of this magnificent art form - its dancers, directors, choreographers and coaches. Manning pushes through the illusions, beyond the stage scenery, and demands more than a conventional response. His 6-chapter documentary is a finely-tuned balance of keynote questions, edgy concerns, light and humorous insights, unhesitating honesty and vigorous imagery. His guests are long-careered world class dancers and choreographers, multi-talented judges and coaches, young prodigies from established companies and neighborhood studios, and a set of still-amazed parents suddenly yanked into social change, daunting challenges, stupefying commitments, and finally - blessed acceptance. Within this nearly 2-hour presentation are the blistering facts about physical training, pain and tolerance of pain, pirates and pirouettes, to eat or not to eat, trophies and tutus, tights and toe shoes. As director, editor, narrator, and composer of the film's incidental music, James E. Manning demonstrates a sharp sense of style, rhythm and timing. The overall tone of Why Dance is warm and inviting, his expert storytellers are engaging and persuasive. Personal anecdotes are bolstered with footage of class work-outs, dress rehearsals and a competition dance routine. Manning's editing is like fine choreography - the separate transitions flow together gracefully with ease and purpose. Why Dance is the perfect gift for the family with that special child who begins moving whenever music is in the air. This documentary merits a spot in every library in every neighborhood and in every school. As the Fine Arts Critic for The San Francisco Sentinel, it is my privilege to cover San Francisco Ballet. The Company attracts and employs the best dancers in the world. Each dancer started in a class with other kids who were probably bouncing off the walls and using common hallways as personal runways. They all know the answer to - Why Dance?</comment>

    <title>A MUST BUY</title>
    <comment>This series wipes the slate clean as far as sci-fi goes. No longer do you have to be considered a nerd to love sci-fi. This series was too cool for the competiton to deal with. The characters were real people and their adventures were bold and very entertaining.The actors were believable and the sets were amazing. The over the top stories were spared and avoided. This show didn't need 3 seasons and multiple incarnations of other series and movies to convince us (the fans) that this show was going to rule all. Get this and you'll see for yourself...I ain't lyin'...</comment>

    <title>Great history - can't hear the strings</title>
    <comment>I enjoyed watching this "Out Of The Blue" tour concert, however I found the sound mix to be a bit disappointing. The cellos and violin hardly can be heard except for a few rare times throughout the concert. In interviews, members of the group have said that the sound within the space ship set was horrible, so I won't assume that the engineers did a poor job. Overall, for the price it's fun to watch that band at their peak despite the lack of the live string section (prerecorded orchestra can be heard).</comment>

    <comment>it's worth watching, but i wouldn't buy it. pros: nice special effects, graphics. cons: the movie was slow getting started, and by the end it had felt sort of like a lord of the rings wannabe.</comment>

    <title>It's not great, but not horrible either</title>
    <comment>The graphics are definately dissapointing, and while it's true that there aren't loading screens every 30 secs., the frame rate is somewhat choppy. You have to figure out how to do things yourself because the book doesn't tell you. Once you get the hang of the inventory, it isn't too bad, though. The combat system is fun and the magic system isn't too difficult. There is a very nice variety of weapons, and hotkeying spells is very nice and almost the same as if you were hotkeying spells in oblivion. The dialogue is boring and very proper. You don't feel like you're interacting with farmers, soldiers and other normal people. It feels as if you talk to highly educated scholars. All that being said, the gameplay is alright, and I would recommend this to a friend because it is fun to be able to play the same game together at the same time, while having the freedom of an RPG.</comment>

    <title>not like Oblivion</title>
    <comment>I got this game because all of the reviews said it was going to be like Oblivion, But when i turned on the game I discoverd the game was nothing like Oblivion. The graphics were horrible. The game looked like it was made for the Playstation 1. The next thing i noticed was the horible acting. I could very easily tell the people were reading from a script, there was almost no emotion in their voices. For a game that was supposed to be like Oblivion, it is not even close. If you are looking for a great RPG, then this is not the game for you.</comment>

    <title>Great</title>
    <comment>Muse have been headlining stadium shows in Europe for years, and with Black Holes and Revelations, they attempt to do the same in the States. Their sound mixes elements of Bends-era Radiohead with the more bombastic parts of Queen and U2. Make no mistake, Muse are not a Radiohead rip-off. They have forged their own sound, particularly on this album. The album begins with the bleak, foreboding Take a Bow, with an aching vocal performance by Matthew Bellamy. Other highlights include the Depeche Mode-esque Map of the Problematique, the anthemic Starlight, and the gorgeous choral elegy Soldier's Poem. Muse should also be seen live at all costs. A very consistent and powerful album, one of the best of 2006.</comment>

    <title>Phenomenal</title>
    <comment>There is nothing ironic in the Black Keys interpretation of the blues on Rubber Factory. These two gentlemen from Akron, OH seem to have discovered Junior Kimbrough and Muddy Waters well before they heard the work of Led Zeppelin and Cream. Their blues is fused with nothing. The first single, 10 am Automatic, should instantly silence skeptics. The beautiful, lap steel tinged Lengths is a welcome respite from the powerful beginning of the album. Aeroplane Blues is CRUSHINGLY loud, as powerful sonically as any blues attempt in the last ten years. Stack Shot Billy and Grown So Ugly feature creatively constructed drum patterns from drummer Patrick Carney. Guitarist/vocalist Dan Auerbach seems to have been gargling with southern fried chicken to sing the way he does on Rubber Factory. A stunning step up from one of the most exciting young bands in the world.</comment>

    <title>Why you need this CD</title>
    <comment>For those of you that know Kweli, there's no need to read this message. If you're 'up in the air' about your next CD purchase or if you really want to experience Hip Hop at its essence, pick this up. As somebody else said, he's slowed it down a bit, but this CD still hits hard and is beyond all the glamour and pop stuff that is out all over the place. It's political, it's real life, it's the streets- that's Talib Kweli. Don't just buy the CD, 'Listen' TO IT! If you want club bangers, this isn't for you, but as Kweli says of other rappers, 'I call 'em baby seals 'cause they club you to death'.</comment>

    <title>Wow</title>
    <comment>This product is amazing. I never used a carpet cleaner before in my house. I own a dyson, and I thought that got my carpets clean, however this unit pulled more dirt out of my carpet. It was amazing. It's easy to use and durable. Some of my favorite features of this unit: A) Tanks on the outside, easy for me to get to and clean and replace liquids. B) Auto Rinse- I feel that I get all of the soap out of carpet C) Auto height adjustment- the unit adjusts the height automatically D) Heated Cleaning- I was told by a best buy associate that this gets around 90% of the water out of the carpet. That's way better than I was expecting. The associate told me that Hoover blows the heat off of the moter onto the carpet to spead up the drying time. The biggest downside is the weight of the unit, but they are all that heavy. All I need now is a Floormate so I can do my kitchens and bathrooms!</comment>

    <title>Great purchase</title>
    <comment>I bought this item to be able to view satellite tv and listen to satellite radio in the garage without running additional coax. After using it for over a week now, the picture and sound quality are fantastic. Installation was very easy. In my setup, the transmitter is roughly 50' and in a straight line from the receiver. Be aware that this runs on 2.4GHz and anything on that frequency, ie. router/cordless phones, will interfere with the signal when in proximity of the transmitter or receiver. I had to purchase new phones since I wanted to keep this item and needed new phones anyway. Bottom line a great purchase for my needs.</comment>

    <title>glorious noise</title>
    <comment>Lou Reed's amphetamine fueled masterpiece White Light/White Heat is the grand predecessor to punk and grunge. The title track directly inspired David Bowie to write his timeless hit Suffragette City. The Gift follows a terrifying John Cale tale over a lurching mutant groove. Cale's delivery is totally devoid of emotion, adding even more discomfort to the track. The final two songs, I Heard Her Call my Name, and Sister Ray, are Lou Reed at his best. His tortured, fractured guitar work will not bring to mind any previous blues scale invented. Sister Ray is the sludgiest, most deafening 23 minute stomp/groove freakout in the storied history of freakouts. It is the perfect way to punctuate one of the most innovative, original, and fearless records of the 60's. White Light/White Heat is a must have.</comment>

    <comment>Just like past PNY products, this module gives great memory performance to the computer. Also increases the number of applications the computer runs. It takes a few moments for the computer to re-configure on initial startup, but on the second and subsequent re-boots, all startups and responses are faster.</comment>

    <title>Wicked Funny</title>
    <comment>I saw this on HBO and fell in love with it. Like many people my age, I grew up on Full House. Danny Tanner was the neat freak dad who never had a hurtful word to say to anyone. This stand up act proves that even the great "Danny Tanner" is human. He pokes fun at himself, as well as his fellow Full House co-stars, America's Funniest Home Videos, and much more. Bob Saget's comedy is more than a little bit raunchy, but if you like a good laugh and are not easily offended, you might consider spending an hour of your time watching this.</comment>

    <comment>I love war movies and this one is one of the best. It can get boring in some places and some scenes are too dark and are hard to see. Russel Crowe does an excellent job protraying the captain of an English ship in a cat and mouse chase with a yankee built French ship. Great movie!</comment>

    <title>easy set up and great results</title>
    <comment>I recently purchased the Rocketfish transmitter / receiver system to create a wireless rear speaker network with my existing speakers. (Recent renovations made wire placement difficult.) I also purchased the Acoustic Research Wireless Speakers (900 MHz) to use in a second room. Both wireless products are excellent, with no contamination from my wireless internet, four cordless phones, wine refrigerator, or other devices. Each piece was easy to set up and the results are exactly what I hoped for. The Rocketfish system is perfect for someone who has a decent set of rear satellite speakers and who doesn't want to run wires from an audio device to these rear satellites. Great job, Rocketfish.</comment>

    <comment>If you liked the movies "Braveheart" and "Gladiator", then you are going to like this movie. It is one testosterone fuel driven ride that catches you from the beginning and never lets go. I loved this movie so much that I purchased it for myself. And if you were to only purchase one film this year, I would highly recommend that this be the one.</comment>

    <title>Not worth the trouble for me</title>
    <comment>I am not a computer guru and that may have been why I had so much trouble with this router. The assistance I received over the phone was pleasant but not much of a help. I read reviews where people had no trouble setting up their D-Link Router, but they also seemed to understand the computer lingo that you have to read through. We returned this product after about 4 days trying to get it set up. Purchased another brand and was set up within minutes with no interruptions.</comment>

    <title>Poor Product Quality</title>
    <comment>Why do you buy Lightscribe CD-Rs? You buy them so that in addition to the audio content, you get reasonable looking graphics. Here's the problem with the Memorex "Cool Colors" Lightscribe CD-Rs...the graphic quality is lousy! It's not the lightscribing process itself that's the problem, it's the fact that parts of the disc come out faded and others don't. I estimate the CDs that I've burned that have come out partially faded or more to be OVER 50% with this brand. That's way too many coasters for my tastes! If you want a colored Lightscribe CD-R, stick with the Verbatim discs, which handle good quality lightscribing much better than these do. Due to the poor quality, I cannot recommend the Memorex Cool Colors Lightscribe CD-Rs!</comment>

    <title>Suggested purchase but should be Essential!</title>
    <comment>This was a suggested purchase by the sales person and I am THRILLED with it. In Tampa we are the lightening capital of the USA and it is common to lose things to lightening strikes on a fairly regular basis and this unit is compact, great looking and so far (knock on wood) has kept my components safe from the almost daily lightening strikes. A MUST HAVE for Floridians to keep their Home Theater Systems and TVs safer! I run my cable box from this and I have not come home to a cable box that needs to be reset with it hooked to the MP HP 1600 but almost daily come home to another box located elsewhere in the house needing to be reset!</comment>

    <title>A smooth introduction to The Tea Party.</title>
    <comment>I'm late in finding this unique, Canadian band and hadn't heard of them until they'd already broken up. Their soulful and Middle Eastern rock sounds really appealed to me, and I found this CD to be a great one. I would not at all consider this to be in the pop music category. "The Bazaar" and "Inanna" were the songs that I knew that made this CD one I really wanted to buy. I believe I've heard a different version of Inanna before, but this one is almost identical and they're both very good. Tracks like "Fire In The Head", "Correspondences", and "Walk With Me" will grow on you after just a couple listens. If you enjoy fantasy and rock, with the mystique of the Middle East-I'd recommend giving this band a shot.</comment>

    <title>Excellent Drive</title>
    <comment>I recently purchased this drive to replace 1 of the two 250GB SATA inside my XPS. I have bene a fan of Seagate drives and this purchase was a no brainer. The price was on point, maybe a few dollars more expensive then some online resellers, but in store purchase = no shipping &amp; the ability to have the drive the same day.</comment>

    <title>Great Compact Carrying Case</title>
    <comment>Although more expensive than other carrying cases, it is worth it. On a recent family vacation where I had to carry lots of bags and extra things (being a mom of an infant and 4 year old), I wanted a way to minimize what I had to carrry. This case enabled me to carry my camera in a small convient case that I could carry on my wrist or throw in the diaper bag. I had no problems finding a carrying case with slots for extra memory cards, but this was the only case I found that had an extra pocket for ID, Credit Card or cash. This case functioned as my purse for my entire week long beach vacation. Great quality, simple yet stylish. Would highly recommend.</comment>

    <title>Very Disappointing</title>
    <comment>The only thing preventing me giving this movie one star is the fact that it had some really great camera work in parts. But really the plot and the acting is this movie are just awful. I know several people that waited months for this movie to hit theaters and we were all very disappointed with the final product.</comment>

    <title>Most Important College Buy</title>
    <comment>I bought this cable lock for college because I knew that going off to a larger school, there might be a chance that someone may steal my lap top. Whenever I am not at my computer, I just plug in the lock and it's as easy as plug in, change the numbers around, and leave it be! I know that it is safe. Specially since I can hook it around the table leg that, by the way, is bolted to the floor. There is no way my lap top is getting stolen! I highly recommend this for any college student, or even anyone who uses hotels or is out of the comfort of their home on a normal basis.</comment>

    <title>Good, but somewhat disappointing</title>
    <comment>Any Guitar Hero fan will be ecstatic at the release of a new game in the series (myself included), but I have to say I'm a bit dissapointed with Rocks the 80s. There are 30 main songs, that's it. Most hardcore GH players will probably beat the game the first day they get it (at least on one difficulty level). Being a full-priced game that's this short and released this far into the PS2's cycle is pretty frustrating. There are some very fun songs (I Ran, Los Angeles, Only A Lad), but there are also some painfully boring ones, and some of the worst choices in any GH game to date (Heat of the Moment, Balls to the Wall, etc.). One of the biggest surprises of Rocks the 80s is the final tier of songs. The Judas Priest and Dead Kennedys songs are decent choices and relatively fun to play, but the last three songs ("Seventeen" by Winger, "Caught In a Mosh" by Anthrax, and "Play With Me" by Extreme, which is a completely puzzling choice being such a relatively obscure song) are not really fun at all. Most any GH player will enjoy this game, even if it does leave a bit to be desired. I bought it the first day, though I don't think I'll be going back to it much.</comment>

    <title>RocketFish Wireless</title>
    <comment>This product is worth the money. I considered the around the wall wiring...too many little holes (for the staples) then I considered under the carpet...very timeconsuming and a lot of problems can occur. Then I researched this product and found that it may "hum" and I got discouraged but read of a simple fix to the "hum" if it occurred. So I bought the kit. It is very nice. Everything you need comes with the kit. I set it up and it sounded great. The receiver part has an amplifier and the rear speakers get a little extra kick from that which helps. Then I shut my home theater off and got the dreaded "hum"....went and purchased two 1 Watt 100 Ohm resistors and bridged the red/back for each speaker on the sender unit....problem solved! Highly recommend this product just do little research if you have the "hum." Dont give up on them because they are great!</comment>

    <title>Great Product</title>
    <comment>I bought this for my husband to put his XM radio reciever on because he snapped one of the clips that came with the original car kit . It is fantastic !! It is easy to use, just snap it together &amp; adjust the swivel head to the direction you want to use it. Suction it to your window in a place out of your way &amp; then place whatever appliance you need it for in &amp; squeeze it till it is holding it firmly. To take it off you just push a single lever &amp; it ratchets open &amp; your appliance comes right out ! I Love it.</comment>

    <title>Not good quality, not good performance</title>
    <comment>I also bought, and have since returned, this product. Its made by Audiovox, so nothing special as far as construction quality. Has two wall warts for power to the units. I tried using it as a transmitter for the video output of my computer, and the image was incredibly noisy, with rolling bars and herringbone waves on the screen. The TV frequently lost its lock on the signal. The audio had a loud hum on all channels. So I also tried it with a DVD player. Same problem. This unit has four channels to choose from for transmit and receive, none worked with adequate quality. I have 5.8 Ghz phones, but I do have a Wireless G network, which is 2.4Ghz. So it's possible this was just the effect of local interference, but, seems to me that this product should be manufactured with that taken into account. To be honest, I'm not a great believer in product review forums like this, so my advice is try it, but be prepared for disappointment and lost time.</comment>

    <comment>Gene Kelly and Judy Garland perform one of there best and last performances together. Even through the troubles Judy was facing she kept on going with the movie and the songs are fantastic. You have to love musicals to love this movie!</comment>

    <title>A fan's must have</title>
    <comment>This is showing KISS through the growing pains. After Peter was fired (regardless of what he says) and Ace left, Gene and Paul decided to carry on with Eric, Vinnie, Mark, and then Bruce, taking the makeup off along the way. It's great to have "Attack of the Phantom" on DVD officially as well. Great concert footage and even an added glimpse of Eric in the hospital after the credits. Watch Ace's drunken interview with Tom Snyder and you can see the cracks starting to show. A must have for any KISS fan.</comment>

    <title>Wonderful Mounts for DefTech Speakers</title>

    <title>Diablo is HOTT</title>
    <comment>An outstanding game created by Blizzard. Fight on Diablo and his minions through many dungeons and levels and explore a time of might and magic. You can choose from a mage and cast spells to a warrior class and fight your way with an arsenal of weapons. It's such a great adventure it's hard to stop playing. Both games are extremly well built and an enormous amounts of fun. I haven't played in years but I want to find my discs to reload this epic adventure on my PC. I'm hoping for a 3rd.</comment>

    <title>an interesting release</title>
    <comment>now if you are looking to buy this dont expect it to be a new game. otherwise itd be guitar hero 3. its only an expansion pack, letting users play classic songs from the 80's. it does try to appeal to an older auidence that would know the songs. overall i enjoyed the game it was fun playing the songs i know. it is disappointing there is no bonus songs but it keeps one busy till guitar hero 3.</comment>

    <comment>This show is by far the best on television today. It is well-scripted, has wonderful actors, and has a lot of real life lessons that are portrayed realistically and has lessons to teach its' viewers. I really do love this show, and you'll have to watch it to see what I mean.</comment>

    <title>Excellent</title>
    <comment>Having watched the first 3 seasons as they aired on TV I couldn't wait to see them again on DVD. I bought this first season set so I could re-enjoy them. They did not dissappoint. Excellent quality on these, nice animated menu system and good quality packaging made this a worthwhile investment. There could have been more to the bonus footage, it was really lame in all honesty, had the bonus stuff been better I would have given it a 5 star + rating.</comment>

    <title>Season 4... Dissappointment.</title>
    <comment>This is what I wrote on the first 3 seasons... "Having watched the first 3 seasons as they aired on TV I couldn't wait to see them again on DVD. I bought this first season set so I could re-enjoy them. They did not dissappoint. Excellent quality on these, nice animated menu system and good quality packaging made this a worthwhile investment. There could have been more to the bonus footage, it was really lame in all honesty, had the bonus stuff been better I would have given it a 5 star + rating." I have now started watching the fourth season, same decent quality, but my set, which I bought from Bestbuy.com, does not have a disc 2. I have 2 disc 3's. This really sucks, I'm getting so into the story line and now I can't finish the series out, I have not tried to call and return them because I bought them over 6 months ago.. I'm going to try later and see what I get for results. This set gets a 2 star because of the low quality packaging missing the second disc...</comment>

    <title>Good But not Great</title>
    <comment>Hot Fuzz was a great movie, but i saw Saun Of The Dead first what i thought they did a much better performance in. Another thing that what was good about Hot Fuzz they took stuff from Saun Of The Dead and did it in Hot Fuzz. I recommend this movie, but watch Saun Of the Dead first.</comment>

    <comment>Crash is a good movie and i thought that this movie showed people what other race do to each other and in the long run it will bit them in the back and haunt them for a long period of time. The fact that it did win best picture is not just because of the performance of the actors but because of what the movie showed hot people treat each other.</comment>

    <title>Great for the price</title>
    <comment>After spending countless hours on the internet searching for an economically price gas range that looks and works good-The Premier (open burner) open my eyes. Its been one month since I have been using it and it's an excellent range compared to those that cost 5 grands and up for the all the additional "bling-bling." Those burners were made to cook. They pump it out alright and comes with a life time warranty compared to those expensive ranges that only comes with one year. Looks good also, built solid, works like a charm. The oven definately puts out the heat when needed yet the outside is cool to the touch. My children enjoys using the grill. I would definately like if the grill were pemanently in the middle instead of removing from storage and-vise-versa. I guess you can't have it all your way. I can live with it. If you are looking for a gas range for cooking and not so much for looks this is definately the range for you especially when you compare cost with the others. Best Buy delivery is impeceable. They called me the night before to confirm delivery time for the next morning, and the delivery driver called me one hour before he showed up at my home at 7am. What service. I even had time to go to work with out taking a day off.</comment>

    <title>Not for me</title>
    <comment>I use Office 2003 for my own college classes so I thought I would treat my future daughter in law with the newest version before she started college this year. I HATE it and wish that I had purchased Office 2003 for her instead. The toolbars are gawdy and crowded and take up too much of the workspace. It uses so much available resources that she has to be careful what she runs while she has one of the applications open. There are some features that she really likes, like OneNote, but more often than not she chooses to work on my PC with Office 2003. We also really dislike that we can not exchange files without loading some format converter. I see a difference in the finished document that I think her professors will like but I just can't see that as enough of a benefit over the downfalls.</comment>

    <title>Excellent love story</title>
    <comment>Two guys living opposites and extreme lives find each other and they discovered that a miracle transformed their lives. They discovered that feeling safe and finding happiness would not strive on embracing the extreme of their religion or party life, but in letting go, become vulnerable, and let one complete the other.</comment>

    <title>One of Denzel's Best</title>
    <comment>This movie has action, drama, suspense, and sci-fi all in one. It is a must see for all Denzel Washington fans. His performance in this movie is without question the best I've seen in a while. Jerry Bruckheimer makes another smashing hit with Dejavu!</comment>

    <title>Best Gift Ever to a TRUE "Friends" FAN!</title>
    <comment>My fiance has a hard time sleeping at night and his solution to this long term problem has been to watch "Friends" because the skits in this show calms him and really puts him at ease. He's been through some rough times and during those times, he used this show to keep him grounded. In fact, he watched the show so often that he felt the show's characters really became his friends. He moved from Texas to be with me in California, and unfortunately lost his only VHS copy of a few episodes during his move. So for the past few months, I've saved enough money to where I was able to purchase this 40 DVD season set of "Friends" for his birthday! He now sleeps soundly! He was so appreciative of his gift that when I presented him with it, a tear slowly rolled down from his swelling eyes. Any fan of "Friends" will enjoy this and for those of you who are not fans, you will soon become one...I DID!</comment>

    <title>Don't waste your time or $$$</title>
    <comment>I appreciate low budget movies on many levels. This is so far the worst movie I have ever seen. Don't be fooled by the cover; that seems to be where most of the movie's budget has been spent. The worst acting EVER! BEWARE : LAME</comment>

    <title>You Wanted the Best...</title>
    <comment>The first disc is the highlight for me. The infamous Tom Snyder interview from 1979 is still hilarious. "KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park" looks incredible. Who knew it was available in widescreen? The movie is actually watchable and almost enjoyable with the 16x9 aspect ratio, the added songs and scenes and even the commentary is engrossing. The other discs have some cool stuff as well, like the first concert KISS performed without makeup - it looks and sounds better than expected. The best concert hands down is the 1990 Hot In The Shade Tour from Detroit. Paul especially gives an amazing show. I believe it's the full show, and it looks and sounds amazing! I'm someone who expected the first edition of KISSOLOGY would be the best, but in my opinion KISSOLOGY Vol 2 is superior in every way, ...except Easter Eggs.</comment>

    <title>Great Series!!! Should not be missed!</title>
    <comment>Friday Night Lights took me by storm when it debuted last year. It has a great story, and real, down to life characters. The story lines are believable, and the characters come across as loving, caring, and truly genuine. I was totally sucked into the experience each and every episode. The way the coach interacts with his players and his family was uplifting. Many comedic moments come during small talk between the coach and his wife, and its great to see. This show is NOT just about football. Actually, I would say football is not even the main thing this series focuses on. It's more about the lives of these characters, and how they all interact in this small football town. It made for great tv, and this DVD is a must buy for me! Would definitely recommend!</comment>

    <title>A Wise Purchase</title>
    <comment>I was a little worried about trying out Verbatim brand of media. I usually stick with TDK all the way and Memorex when I can't get TDK. These Verbatim DVD-Rs are certified for 16x, I've got an LG 20X DVD Writer and with these discs burn at 20x by default. NO coasters yet with this media in my LG DVD Writer, I must say that these DVD-Rs are excellent. Will have to purchase some more when then go on sale, so now I'll be getting either Verbatim or TDK, can't go wrong with either really. Don't think, just purchase this wonderful working media.</comment>

    <title>Not Out Great</title>
    <comment>This season is not out on DVD yet, but it is outsanding. I have it on my iPod and I will own the discs. It is a humanizing season for the Turks. Baby Isabella is adorable. Dr. Cox becomes a dad again, but can't celebrate because of tragedy. Elliot and Keith move forward. JD ends the season by portentiall doing something "nuclear". Buy this when it comes out.</comment>

    <comment>I don't own one - YET!! I borrowed my neighbors and fell in love with it within the first 5 minutes of use! It works great! I love the fact that if you go over the carpet a few times with just the machine (no cleaning solution dispursed), it dries the carpet so that you can walk on it within minutes of cleaning!</comment>

    <title>A must own for any Sci-fi/action buff</title>
    <comment>John Carpenter's Escape From New York was the blueprint for all other action films of the early 80's. Set in the not too distant crime plagued year of 1997, the film is a chilling representation of a new America which has turned into a police state and the entire island of Manhattan is turned into the one maximum security prison for the dregs of a society beginning to crumble. Kurt Russel plays S.D. "Snake" Pliskin, a once highly decorated soldier, now a man sentenced to life imprisonment for a failed bank robbery. But before he is to be sentenced, the President (played by long time Carpenter collaborator Donald Pleasance,) finds himself and his jettisoned escape pod from Air Force one to be the latest inhabitants of a savage New York. The Chief of the United States Police Force (veteran B-movie actor Lee Van Cleef) makes Pliskin a deal, find the President within 24 hrs and Pliskin will receive a pardon for his crimes but there's one catch, the Chief has a technician place 2 microscopic explosive charges in Pliskin's neck which will explode within the 24 hr deadline. It soon becomes a race against time for pliskin to find the President, retrieve a briefcase which was suppose to be delivered to a summit meeting between the Chinese and the Soviets in Hartford, CT of all places, and keep his head from exploding. Escape From New York is one of my all time favorite action/Sci-fi films and was shot for a staggering amount ($6,000,000.) It's the perfect blend of science fiction, a 40s detective noir, and a western to some extent. A must see and own for any fan of such genres.</comment>

    <comment>It's a very funny movie, about the dating relationship that men &amp; women go thru. It's about a guy who meets a girl at a night club, they have some laughs, dance, and to many drinks, and then she gets pregnant. So now plans change for the both of them. Dealing with life changing choices about growing up and responibility.</comment>

    <title>Terrible Game</title>
    <comment>The graphics are the first thing you notice, they look like early 1990's graphics and that looks very bad on an HDTV setup. The graphics are so bad that when you are looking at your inventory items you can't tell the difference between any small items in the inventory. The dialogue is delivered poorly and corny. The frame rate is very low and the game does not flow smoothly due to this low frame rate. The only line you will wait in is the resale shop line to unload this game before you can't get anything for it. During it's release week the game is already worth less that half the new value and is dropping fast. I returned my game the same day I bought it during release week and the comment I got was, "I was not the first to trade this game in," and that actually did not surprise me. it was clear that the resale shops already know "Two Worlds" is a bad game.</comment>

    <comment>This movie is one of those movies that make you breathe a little harder, open your eyes a little wider and thank god you're not where these women are. It's about some girlfriends who go cave diving trip,but they make one little mistake, a cult of flesh eating creatures are living in that same deep, dark, cave and their hungry for human flesh.</comment>

    <title>Zoom lens I needed!!!</title>
    <comment>After using the G version of this lens, I was amazed at how heavy this was in comparison..but it was very easy to handhold with my D50. VR feature is great, I don't have to use a tripod for pictures at 1/60. I used to get blurry pictures with the G version of the lens even at 1/125 or more. It also gave me the reach that I needed for zoo pictures and some moon shots that I took yesterday before and around the lunar eclipse. The other great thing about this lens is the bokeh, even at 70-100 range...pictures of my kids look so beautiful with the blurred background. Highly recommended for a general walkabout telephoto zoom.</comment>

    <title>the queen of grunge</title>
    <comment>PJ Harvey's first album arrives with a complete sound constructed. There is not an ounce of effort or conviction wasted. Sheela-na-gig is what Nirvana would sound like with a female singer. Oh my Lover is one of Harvey's best early vocal performances. The crushing one-two punch of Dress and Victory will always be live favorites. A song that flies under the radars of a lot of Harvey's fans is her phenomenal seventh track, Hair. Drummer Rob Ellis is a logical precursor to Radiohead drummer Philip Selway's creativity and precision in the 90's. Throughout the album, Harvey's lyrics are alternately angry and pleading. An incredible debut, especially considering that her only near miss 15 years later was 1998's Is This Desire?</comment>

    <comment>The only bad thing about this movie, was that I didn't get a chance to see it on the big screen. If you thought Gladiator was a great movie, all I can say is you haven't seen anything yet! What makes DVD's so great is that they include commentary, background into the making of the movie, and shows you how the film the made. It was not only enteraining, visually and emotionally, but it was educational as well.</comment>

    <title>This show is AMAZING!!! More then 5 stars!</title>
    <comment>I have followed Supernatural since Season 1 and I absolutely love it. I have introduced this show to friends and family and they have quickly become drawn into it. It is a mixture of suspense, horror and oddly enough - humor. It covers many urban legends that are well known from vampires and werewolves to ones less seen like genies and Nordic tricksters. It even includes a killer clown in season 2. The plots are well written and you can tell the writers have researched the backgrounds of the urban legends involved. The original story line throughout this season and last is very engaging and leaves you wanting more. It is the kind of show that gains a cult following.</comment>

    <title>A Good Horror Anime</title>
    <comment>This anime has to be one gruesome anime to ever be seen, this is definitely not for kids, with its extreme graphical violence and horror. Its strange mysteries about the village called "Hinamizawa" and its mysterious murders about the people that live their. It starts off with a transfer student who moved to that village and finds an article about a murder that happened at the village. He has some friends he just made at school who are keeping a secret from him that concerns that mysterious murder. He keeps asking them what happened, but every time he asks them they act like they don't know in a scary yet mysterious way. Until he goes in a little too deep than something bad starts happening around him. This volume comes with the first 5 episodes and a reversible cover.</comment>

    <comment>If you are looking for songs to be in love with, than this is an album to get. Ms. Michele could put you in the mind of a mixture of Erkah Badu and Jill Scott with that jazz feel. Just press play and listen as Chrisette Michele takes you on a journey of love and being in love.</comment>

    <title>Best Action Movie of 2007</title>
    <comment>From the same person that brought you Sin City, Frank Miller brings another classic action pack movie. I go to the movies on a regular and this movie has made other movies look very dull. 300 could be the Best Action Movie of 2007 or Best Movie of the Year.</comment>

    <title>Worth The Wait!</title>
    <comment>I couldn't wait to get this. I absolutely love it. Every song is different. Constantine has done it! He's made a cd that you will want listen to... every single song and you will not push the skip button. "Fading into you" is a beautiful song and he sings it beautifully. The "T-Shirt song" is going to be a fun hit. Kids, teens and adults will love it. "Midnight Radio" was made for him... incredible. "So Long" is amazing, a #1 for sure. Constantine has an incredible vocal range. The only problem with the cd is I wish there were more!!! I can't wait for the next one.</comment>

    <title>Constantine Rocks!</title>
    <comment>Constantine Maroulis' debut solo album was well worth the wait. He put his heart and soul into this CD and it definitely shows. It's very diverse, thus having something for everyone. From the feel good song "Everybody Loves" to the soft, slow, romantic "Fading Into You". to the fun, autobiographical "Favorite T-Shirt", you will find a variety of music to tap your toe or sing along with. I highly recommend "Constantine" for everyone who enjoys good music.</comment>

    <title>360s worst</title>
    <comment>So I have been reading different forums boards and blogs about two worlds and many of them were sites where half the people talked about how terrible the game is and the other side telling how great it is. In my experience with two worlds I was terribly disappointed my reasons being. 1. The hype on this game was throwing three independent games that were great into one those games being Oblivion diablo and fable. This game is nothing like Oblivion not even close in any way or form. They say the skills and stat trees/inv were like diablos only thing remotely close was the trees....the inventory was more like dungeon siege. As to fable fighting and hotkeying is similar, but fable is ahead of this game in that form. 2. When I looked at the character customization I was unsure wether to laugh or cry. 3. What happend to the 11 different races you could choose from? 4. The game lags in single player. 5. Anyone remember battlefront online? Take that things lag and triple it and it is around there. 6. Do these horses have minds of their own or something? I tried to control one for 25 minutes before finally giving up. This game was suppose to be a leap in mmorpg/rpg's and be the next-gen standard or so it says on the back of the games case. I believe this game would have met those standards if they took their time on the game...unfortunately it seems it was rushed or atleast to me, but this is one mans opinion do not buy it rent before hand.</comment>

    <comment>I had the privilege of viewing this marvelous film on Imax, then rented the DVD. I was just as entertained. This movie is a great study if you're a film major or wish to enter the entertainment industry. The special effects are top tier and the ensemble cast hits the ball out of the park!! If you loved Gerard Butler as the phantom in "Phantom of the Opera," you'll certainly fall in love with him as King Leonidas! He shows how REAL MEN are supposed to treat their women. Bravo!</comment>

    <title>Family Fun</title>
    <comment>If you are a game player looking for lots of action, this game is not for you. This is very low key game with lots of old time fun. The challenges are very straight forward, but it definitely has a certain charm to it. As you play, the carnies taunt you just like you are at a real carnival. What could be more fun than having a video character insult you with little digs as you are trying to throw a ball in a cup. Definitely a fun game for family and friends. Also, lots of little surprises as you play.</comment>

    <title>Extremely disappointing</title>
    <comment>It arrived at my door and was really excited to open the box and found an extremely disappointing case. Only buy it if you want a ChapStick holder. I doubt this would fit most cameras on the market. It certainly didn't fit my Cybershot, in fact it probably wouldn't even fit half of it. I will now have to return it for something that might actually fit a camera. I only gave it a two because it's well constructed and if it were larger it would be a great design. I guess I learned my lesson, don't buy a case online.</comment>

    <title>The Doctor returns for a new set of adventures!</title>
    <comment>In the third series of the new run of Doctor Who, David Tennant's 10th Incarnation returns weary from battle and the loss of his companion Rose Tyler. In this season he is joined by the young medical student Martha Jones, played by Freema Agyeman. This season also contains the return of former companion Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), and the arrival of a terrible former rival of the Doctor's who may well spell the end of the human race. Continuing the breathtaking visuals and compelling stories of the first two series, the creative team returns with stories of Shakespeare, Intergalactic Traffic Jams, an alien plot surrounding the construction of the empire state building, and a story where the Doctor goes on the ultimate adventure, becoming human. In addition to the amazing episodes of the third season, this DVD set also includes the Season Three run of "Doctor Who Confidential" the Children in Need concert special, audio and in-vision commentaries and other behind the scenes extras. A must-have for any and all sci-fi collections, Whovians and non-Whovians alike. :)</comment>

    <comment>The graphics are absolutely terrible. The dialogue doesn't match the faces and uses alot of thou, art, thus etc. The game play is also poor, with a one slash combat set up. Not near the depth of Oblivion. Any positive advertisement for this game is false advertisement.</comment>

    <title>Method Man drops a classic with his debut!!!!!</title>
    <comment>1994 was tremendous, as I've said time and time again. I'm here to set the record straight with Method Man's debut album, Tical. One year after coming off of the successful and classic debut Wu-Tang album, Meth was the first to step up to the plate and release the first Wu solo album, to much hype. A lot has been said about this album, that it was weak, average, disappointing, what have you. But the bottom line (which will be addressed in The Last Word) is that this album represents Meth in his prime, representing in a way that he SHOULD'VE represented on his second album. Here's the COMPLETE review: Album Highlights: Tical, Biscuits, Bring The Pain, All I Need, What The Blood Clot, Meth vs.Chef (listen as Meth and Rae do battle, just for fun), Release Yo Delf, I Get My Thang In Action, Stimulation, and Mr.Sandman (RZA and Inspektah Deck KILL this track) and Method Man(Remix). Production: Thumbs up. RZA was only two releases away from his most defined production work ever is Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. RZA's production gems are Bring The Pain, Meth vs. Chef, What The Blood Clot. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. This was back in the days before cars, women, clothing, jewerly, etc was the order of the day. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: Here's the deal. Is the album a CLASSIC? In so many words yes!!!!! This album is NOT up there with the likes of Raekwon and GZA's first albums, but it's excellent in it's own right. It's an excellent first album from Meth, and it's strong enough for a four star rating. Overall, I strongly recommend this for the fans of the early Wu-Tang, back when things were original in hip hop music.</comment>

    <title>Good looking stand</title>
    <comment>This stand was somewhat of a pain to assemble, but I guess it could have been worse. Patience, reading the instructions and looking at the diagrams is a must. But once all is together, the stand is very sturdy and has plenty of room. I have a Phillips 42" LCD TV, a PS3, and a Pioneer receiver on the stand, and the bottom shelf is still empty. I will probably put movies on the bottom shelf, or my HTPC. Even though the stand was only designed for 40" LCD TVs and smaller, it works great with my 42". I would definitely purchase this product again with no hesitation.</comment>

    <title>Great product</title>
    <comment>I bought this to replace an old Bissell. This works so much better that our old one. It's very easy to set up and use. I purchased back in June and have had to use it numerous times. My in-laws purchased the same one on my suggestion and had nothing but good things to say about it. It really removes the stains and cleans the carpets. The tools work great on my stairs. It doesn't leak either. That was my one big complaint about our old one, it always leaked out the bottom after we used it. No complaints on this product. I'm getting ready to purchase one as wedding gift for my brother and sister-in-law.</comment>

    <title>Nice Feature Rich Router</title>
    <comment>Nice router with more features than I want to worry about. One of the nice things is I don't have to, the default configuration is pretty good. I tried a couple Netgear 802.11n routers because the range/speed numbers were larger butt I could not get them to work on my network. Straight out of th box this router started working and with some change to the security settings I was well on my way.</comment>

    <title>Fantastic Travel Bag</title>
    <comment>I've always used a conventional laptop case but found that I carried too many "External" devices and gagets that I couldn't find space for in them. When I found the Targus Large Computer Backpack I knew I had to have one. I have packed this bag to the fullest and all the compartments and spaces it has is the best I've ever run across so far. There is a padded space for a large laptop, cooling pad, external HD, external DVD/CD-R/W, cell phone, chargers, docking station, documents, external wireless antenas and cards, USB Hubs, Extension coils, S-Vid coils, AC Adapters, jump drives, CDs/DVDs, and much more if you can believe it. This bag is GREAT and when you think it won't fit into the overhead compartment all you have to do is unbuckle the outside flap and in it slips right in, no problem! I love it! The only flaw I found in much heavy use was one of the pocket seams was beginning to split open a bit but then remember, this bag has a lifetime warranty. If you want to have all your gagents and gear with you when you travel this is the bag for you! Highly Recommend it.</comment>

    <title>The Quest is over</title>
    <comment>This is, in my opinion, the best Jean-Claude van Damme's best martial arts movie. I like the differences of the fighting styles that are included in this film. It has characters from all over the globe competing in a tournament to win a golden dragon. Of course there are twists and turns and a lot of martial arts action.</comment>

    <title>Favorite pair of headphones EVER...and inexpensive</title>
    <comment>Nothing but thumbs of up for these headphones. The pair I have lasted me for probably a good 5 years... which included me putting them through all sorts of weather conditions... rolling over both wire and ear piece with my desk chair... hassles of vacations and travels. My left ear piece finally gave out the other day at work... and I was sad, but I am definitely going out to get this item again</comment>

    <comment>Frieza Saga has one of the longest fight sequences in history and is often joked about in Anime circles that it takes 5 episodes to charge up a kamehameha and in 5 minutes Namek is suppose to explode yet it takes 6 hours of episodes for that to actually hapen but EVERYONE knows about it. Classic Anime.</comment>

    <title>No Turtle power,kid power instead</title>
    <comment>This movie is for the kids more than adults. It's not the turtles from the 80's but it's fulled with action that will get your kids out thier seats saying "turtle power". My verdict buy it for your kids they'll thank you for it.</comment>

    <comment>Ours is a sad world when Everybody Loves Raymond lasts for 10 seasons and Arrested Development lasts for 3. It is by far the best show of the decade. The narrative is constantly engrossing and rarely loses focus. The faux-reality angle always works as well. One factor that cost the show longevity is that there is no laugh track. Pretty sad that we can't like a comedy unless we are told when to laugh. The show flew over the heads of most Americans, and FOX didn't know how to market it. The 3 year run that Arrested Development had is one of the best in the history of TV.</comment>

    <title>The Show and the Price</title>
    <comment>I absolutely LOVE the show, but I would like to point of that this isn't really the "best buy" out there. I won't name names but I know a popular store that has it priced at only $37.99!</comment>

    <title>Odd</title>
    <comment>The first three tracks from this "Of Montreal" album flow together very well. The three songs have a solid beat and give false hopes for the rest of the CD. Unfortunately, after the first three songs, the CD begins to fall apart.... songs don't have consistant beats and the words don't rhyme, which is distracting. Not the worst CD i have ever purchased, but far from the best.</comment>

    <comment>After all thses years Halloween still holds up.This movie still at my age still manages to give me chills because of how great the directing by John Carpenter and a good performance by one of the Queens of Scream Jamie Lee Curtis.For those who haven`t seen it,it still is not to late.WATCH IT.</comment>

    <comment>The first nightmare that started it all will have you up all night with fear of going to sleep. Check the closets, lock the doors, and bar your windows. 1,2 Freddy's coming for you. 3,4 better lock your doors. 5,6 get a crucifix. 7,8 better stay up late. 9,10 never sleep again.</comment>

    <comment>I am so happy to have the 2nd season of Soulfood! This was a great show that I know many people loved and for all who couldn't catch it on Showtime waited patiently for this to be released. I'm not exactly sure what the hold up was, but hopefully the TRUE FANS of Soulfood won't have to wait another 4 years for the 3rd season.</comment>

    <title>Should have Stuck with Western Digital</title>
    <comment>I don't know if I will keep this or take it back. Just bought it today. Computer bios recognized the drive right away but Windows XP Pro would not recognize until I unhooked other drives and booted with my Windows disk. The drive finally partitioned and is formatting now after several hours of getting nowhere. So far the disk cloning software that came with this drive doesn't work which is the main problem. It wants you to buy cloning software for $30.00. The software that came with this drive doesn't recognize it. I'm disgusted to say the least. I should have spent another $40.00 and got the WD drive. Never have had a problem with them.</comment>

    <title>Disc Mix-Up</title>
    <comment>Heh. I had pretty much the exact same problem. LOVE the series, but when I opened up the set I had 2 disc 2s and no disc 1! Really disappointing. Absolutely nothing to do with the BestBuy service, but I would have expected more from a mass media production. Very disappointing. Apparently we all need to open up Babylon 5 season 4 when we're still in the store :P</comment>

    <title>CLASSIC Jay-Z, Hip Hop will never be the same</title>
    <comment>Man, in 1996, hip hop was a different place. My favorite MC at the same (and still is today) Nas was reigning supreme with the release of his EXCELLENT sophomore album "It Was Written." But, little did I know that Jay-Z, at the time an almost unknown, would drop such an album that would be described as classic in every sense of the word. THIS album is NOTHING like you would find in hip hop today. What's in this album is ABSENT from hip hop today: lyrics, originally, true subject matter, consistency. Many artists don't score too big with the first album, but Jay-Z, just like Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Rakim, among others, scored, and he hit a home run. I could go on and on about this album, but let me just say that it's an awesome experience listening to this. Most cats might've slept on Jigga during 96, but years later, those same cats' eyes bugged with surprise when they heard this for the first time. Before you see my overall opinion on this masterpiece, let's do a little rundown on the Jay-Z albums "post Reasonable Doubt." In My Lifetime Vol. 1 (4 1/2 stars, with the exception of 3 songs, you know what they are if you own this album. This album is excellent, even with the things Jay-Z was going through during the making of the album, otherwise, it's great, and "Streets is Watching," "Imaginary Player", "Friend Or Foe 98", "You Must Love Me" and the album's BEST track "Where I'm From" make this album worthwhile) Vol.2...Hard Knock Life (3 stars. Classic? Not really, the title track, "N**** What N**** Who", "Money, Cash, H***", and "A Week Ago" are bangers, the rest of the album is boring for the most part and it lost SERIOUS points with me because nearly EVERY song featured another artist.) Vol.3...Life and Times of S.Carter (3 1/2 stars. Seriously, his most disappointing album, nuff said. Preview this album BEFORE purchase.) The Dyansty Roc La Familia (4 mics. Excellent album. He mananged to try and make stars out of Beanie, Bleek, and Amil, guess who it worked for, otherwise, he offered some gems on this one, check out "Streets Is Talking", "Stick 2 Da Script", and "Parking Lot Pimping".) The Blueprint (5 stars. Released on 9/11/01, the day I bought it, this album is CLASSIC material. He did the majority of SOLO and made one of the best albums of 2001.) MTV Unplugged (Jay-Z LIVE, nuff said.) Blueprint 2...The Gift and The Curse (4 stars. Excellent double album from him, with some filler that should not have made the album.) The Black Album (4 1/2 stars. Would've been the perfect album to completely retire on, until.... Kingdom Come (3 1/2 stars. Not my idea of an awesome comeback album, but pretty good nonetheless.) But back this Reasonable Doubt classic, BUY THIS NOW if you don't own it. It's worth your time and money. Album Highlights: THE ENTIRE LP.</comment>

    <comment>I would write a HUGE paragragh saying to buy this but if your looking at season 2 then you obviously have seen season one and know that this show really does kick A@%. I love the show so much I paid 400$ ticket to go see Jensen and Jared live and in person!!! This show beats Smallville, Heroes, Scrubs, 24 put together! Sorry if this review wasn't helpful. P.s. what im trying to say is BUY IT!!!</comment>

    <title>does what it claims</title>
    <comment>Absolutely wonderful speaker. Sounds great under all circumstances (gaming, movies, music.) It is not a loudspeaker, it is an ambient speaker. Often times people make adjustments on their recievers to have the rear speakers output the same as the front, which defeats the purpose of an ambient speaker. Overall, I got what I expected from a quality product at a good price.</comment>

    <title>Horrible game - locks Wii</title>
    <comment>This game would be fun if it didn't have a glitch that locked the Wii to the point of needing to unplug it and replug. Others have complained of this same glitch on the Nintendo forums so it appears to be a fault with the game instead of just a bad disk. I can't stress how frequently this happens. If they had done any testing before release this bug would have shown up</comment>

    <title>awesome</title>
    <comment>this is one of my favorite movies. the editorial is very biased, i think this movie deserves way better comments than that waste of space. It's an awesome action movie, great plot, and has many spots that makes you laugh. It has a few parts that seemed like they got pulled out of thin air, but that's in every movie due to budget and time restrictions. I love tis movie, very much recommended by me.</comment>

    <title>Excellent product</title>
    <comment>My friend picked up this system a few days before I did and seemed pleased with his purchase. Not recognizing the name brand, I did a little research online and found all but one review to be very positive about this product (the one negative one is listed here on the Best Buy site). I purchased the product the next day and found it to be easy to hook up. I turned it on and everthing "linked up" as advertised and the speakers were working just fine. I had to go into my home theater setup and boost the power to the speakers, but after I did that the sound was great. I have not had any of the problems with a hum coming from the speakers when my home theater system is off (as some reviews mentioned). The only reason I didn't give this product five stars is because you do have to manually turn the system on and off. Honestly though, it's a small annoyance. The product works great for both music and movies and is a steal at $99.99. When it comes down to it, the performance of the system far outweighs having to switch it on and off by hand.</comment>

    <title>Excellent Decision</title>
    <comment>I used my Nuvi 360 with the winshield mount and it kept coming off driving from NC to FL. When I was in FL, I purchased this Auto Friction Mount and it was the best decision I made. My GPS stayed in one spot on the Dash, did not move an inch; especially making sharp turns. It stayed in one spot driving back from FL. It works good with Leather dashboard(s). I used it on a 01 Oldsmobile Aurora and it fit fine on a dash that has many curves. I also used it on a 02 Cadillac Seville STS and the fit was good; it didn't go anywhere.</comment>

    <comment>I have had to have the electronic control pad replaced twice now. If the smallest amount of water, your cooking on the stove with water usually BTW, gets into the touch pad it frys it. Horrible design must have been made and never used in real world cooking situations. I could design a better stove.</comment>

    <title>Pretty neat</title>
    <comment>I am surprised this had bad reviews so far. It is a bit different at first, but it does offer to show you how the new layout works and why it is so effective. I was really impressed by it. Microsoft seems to finally be coming around on being more visually appealing and offering programs that clearly are easier to work with. I recommend this for anyone who might have a busy schedule like I do. While it does take a small bit of time to get use to and learn about - it saves a lot of time and makes more sense in the long run. So - if you have an hour or so to spare to learning about all the cool new features - then this is definitely for you. If you are someone who doesn't use many features in these programs, then upgrading might not be necessary. Overall though - I was really impressed - way to go Microsoft!</comment>

    <title>Unprecedented Value!!!</title>
    <comment>When i purchased this product it was met with merciless criticism and unrealistic expectations. I had the mindset that this product will not only have to justify its hefty pricetag, but validate my sanity as well. To my relief, this product did more than just meet my criteria. The sound that the skullcrushers exhibit is nothing short of amazing. The high frequencies are crystal clear and the lows have enough power to unfocus your vision, if you need it that loud. I am glad that i didnt settle for the cheaper headsets, I can truly say that i am satisfied with my purchase.</comment>

    <title>80's Rock-a-buy</title>
    <comment>I managed to catch the game for $40.00, and do I feel like it was completely worth it? Nah. I wish I had held out a little longer for the price to drop even more. This is a $25.00 - $30.00 game at best. But price aside, I do enjoy the game though it seemed a bit easier than its predessor, lacked bonus characters and songs. It's a good game for GH fans, but, my advice, hold out for GH 3 to come out and Rock the 80's price to drop. Heck, Christmas time is approaching, they'll probably make them a combo pack. "Hold on loosely, but don't let go."</comment>

    <title>Greatest movie I ever saw.</title>
    <comment>This movie is great. It talks about a girl whom lives near the bayous of New Orleans and how she is trying to explain how we need these to stand up to dissasterous hurricanes. But what she doesn't know is that a hurricane is brewing. Close to the last minute...her family goes inland and survives with her pets...when she goes back to her home...she is sad because of the flood. To see more information on this movie...watch it.</comment>

    <title>Best Show on TV</title>
    <comment>Studio 60 was last year's best debut: a clever, fun and well-written drama that covered a lot of the same ground as the unoriginal, uninspired, insipid "30 Rock" which flourished on the same network that cancelled S60. It's a crime that this show wasn't picked up for a second season; Nevada Day and The Wrap Party alone have more humor and heart in them than full seasons of most shows.</comment>

    <title>better than the big chill!</title>
    <comment>This is the best movie I have ever seen! Loved Linsey, Jane Fonda is spectacular and her role as a grandma was awesome. I would recommend this to everyone I know. It tackles the issue of molestation which I think is an important discussion to have with children who may watch this with you. There are some parts that are a bit embarasing if you have your mom with you or something!!</comment>

    <title>Will Smith should be a postman... he delivers 24/7</title>
    <comment>Enemy of the State is a great thriller w lots of action and intriguing sub-plots... Will Smith is terrific at portraying a man put into a situation that is beyond his control without reason...the movie is realistic in giving a "what would you do" feeling if u were in Smith's position... The movie also incorporates Smith humor and adds a lighter touch to avoid too dark a theme... Gene Hackman is outstanding as playing the 'ace in the deck of cards" and is fun to watch with Smith... Regina King is great at playing the worried and at times less than understanding and suspicious wife and the kid that plays Smith's son is a cute kid and delivers a nice performance... this is one of my favorite movies!!</comment>

    <title>A Keeper!</title>
    <comment>This is one game, I won't be "trading up" for! No problems with the game here! No "crashing" issues, or problems with a "bug". I have played all the games at least once or twice, and I'm VERY pleased with this game! On to the review.. Graphics are typical of Wii games, like Wii Play and Sports. Basic Mii inspired characters you can build to play with. You can choose single or multi player mode, up to four players. Your storyline is true to a day at the Carnival, with the exception of spending your life savings to win a teddy bear. This is one of the more affordable Wii titles, at a low $39.99! There are over 25 popular carnival games from dunk tank, pigskin pass, to baloon darts, collecting tickets and small, medium, and large prizes, based on how well you do, that you can trade up for larger prizes. Use your tickets to play games such as a love meter, fortune teller, or skill crane machine. And all the games are true to the actual games you would play at the fair. Sometimes the skill crane drops your toy, just like in reality. Games are organized into five different alleys. Fortune Way, Love Lane, Rodent Row, Claw Alley, and Lucky Pass. You also play to unlock over 5 more games. The games certainly aren't easy. They are VERY true to carnival games, which as you know aren't easy. Who would want a game that you can master in less than an hour? That would be boring, and certainly a waste of money. A true carnival game fan will appreciate the likeness, and difficulty of the games. Large prizes are difficult to get. Play time depends on how much time you WANT to spend. From 5 minutes to a couple hours. So many games to play that there are enough games to play through for an entire hour, and not play the same game twice, although, I guarantee you will! Much like a real carnival, you get sucked into playing.. JUST ONE MORE TIME. You believe you have gotten the hang of it, or you get sooo close, you know you can get it! Sounds are typical of a carnival, chatter, game sounds, and direction from the carnies. Even heckling coming from the dunk tank and the carnies. You get to use the Wii mote in a variety of ways, not just aiming and clicking. From shaking, shooting, overhead tossing, darting, and more! Definately a game that takes some skill! Fun for all ages, for a single player, or a couple. I am VERY pleased with Carnival. I have been looking forward to this game for a couple months. And I think that Global Star, and Nintendo delivered a great game!! Anyone who loves to spend time at the Boardwalk, or a day at the fair, would LOVE this game!</comment>

    <title>The Painless HD Upgrade Purchase</title>
    <comment>I've long preferred Western Digital hard drives (especially the Caviar SE series); the 320 GB and 500 GB SATA SE16 drives continue proving why. While these are SATA 3.0 drives, they are backward-compatible with earlier SATA-150 interfaces, so they will still work (albeit at the slower SATA-150 speeds), and unlike most other SATA drives, they still use the standard four-pin molex power connectors used by older IDE/ATAPI drives, so you don't need adapters for the power cabling. They also include DataLifeguard Tools (for both DOS and Windows) so migrating your files from your old drive is a cinch; even better, the included manual walks you through the entire process of adding the new drive to your existing system (either as an additional drive, or as a replacement/upgrade for your current boot drive), even if your computer is one of those that includes a *restore partition* (like most OEM computers these days). WD remains my recommended hard drive brand of choice.</comment>

    <title>Horray for the "Zed" word</title>
    <comment>Shaun of the Dead is one of the most original concepts for a zombie/comedy since Peter Jackson's Dead Alive. The film stars Simon Pegg who plays Shaun, a aimless t.v. salesmen who has no ambition whatsoever and spends his time with his buddy Ed who is just as lazy as he. When zombies begin to over run London, it's up to Shaun, his girlfriend Liz, Ed, and Liz's flat mates to stay alive by what they have learned from zombie movies. This is one of my favorite releases and I appriciate it the more times I see it. An outstanding cast and great, repeatable dialogue make it an instant classic for horror fans the world over.</comment>

    <title>Hip Hop will never be like this again!!!!!</title>
    <comment>1995 was an excellent year in hip hop. Nas, Wu-Tang, The Notorious BIG, Mobb Deep, Kool G. Rap, 2-Pac, and others DOMINATED. There was no Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz, no Nelly, No Chingy, no Mims, no Richboy or any of these wack rappers that dominate hip hop today. In 95, there was REAL hip hop, so real that it'll never be this REAL again. With Wu-Tang already a household name, they went for the kill in 95, and boy did they serve up a CLASSIC. Raekwon and Ghostface Killah teamed up to deliver "Only Built 4 Cuban Linx", one of my all time favorite albums and one of the greatest albums ever released, PERIOD. This one album has ALWAYS been part of my collection since it was released. They were on top of their game and one AWESOME album resulted. Here's the review: Striving For Perfection (An album where even the INTRO is classic. Simply put, Rae and Ghost want the best for themselves and each other.) Kunckleheadz (Rae, Ghost, and U-God flowing viciously over a head banging track with hard lyrics.) Knowledge God (This song is a classic and RZA's beat here is something to behold.) Criminology (Rae and Ghost, no, it's not a subject in school, but with this track, you would think that rae and ghost would be the professors.) Incarcerated Scarfaces (Another Rae solo that's simply awesome.) Rainy Dayz (Rae and Ghost, a classic song talking about life's hard times, but in end we all make it through.) Guillotine(Swordz) (Rae, Ghost, GZA, Inspektah Deck, everyone spits fire on this track, absolutely thrilling.) Can It Be All So Simple (Remix) (Rae and Ghost, it had to be a remix, and boy did they deliver on this one.) Shark ****** (Biters) (On this interlude, they warn you, don't EVER bite the Wu, nuff said.) Ice Water (Rae, Ghost, Cappa, the song that introduce the world to Cappadonna. Dope stuff here. ) Glaciers Of Ice (Rae, Ghost, Masta Killa, lyrical dars just thrown.) Verbal Intercourse(Rae, Ghost, and Nas deliver an AWESOME spectacle with one of the greatest verses EVER by my favorite MC, Nas.) Wisdom Body (Ghost would give us a preview of IronMan here.) Spot Rusherz (Listen to Rae go Kool G. Rap style on this one. Excellent storytelling that you don't hear anymore.) Ice Cream(Rae, Ghost, Meth, and Cappa deliver this classic single. Who says that the Wu don't like the ladies?) Wu Gambinos(Rae, Ghost, Rza, Meth, and Masta Killa, straight bangin, classic Wu here.) Heaven &amp; **** (Rae and Ghost give you something to think about here, what do YOU believe in, heaven or ****?) Bonus Track: North Star (Jewelz) (This is the PERFECT way to end an album). Overall, this is ANOTHER MUST HAVE, an album that defined what the Wu sounded like in their prime and the possibly the BEST production that the RZA's ever been responsible for. Cop this NOW if you don't own it. You WILL NOT be disappointed. One of the greatest albums of all time.</comment>

    <title>Overpriced</title>
    <comment>As everyone knows, all Bose products are between 2 and 4 times as expensive as they should be for the features and/or quality. These headphones are decent-sounding but extremely overpriced. On some music, they sound boomy. On other music, they sound fine. If you get them as a gift, be glad. They're as good as most on-sale-for-$50 cans from Sennheiser or other top headphone companies. But for this price? Give me a break!</comment>

    <title>The Best Series Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</title>
    <comment>I kept up with Soul Food since the first time I watched the show. I loved it so much because it hits home in a lot of areas. Also, the cast went through real life, not like some of these shows where u can't tell if its real or not. I HAVE ALREADY reccomended Soul Food to several of my friends, and I know they will be purchasing it soon. I hope we won't have to wait too long for seasons 3 and 4.</comment>

    <title>The Metal Gods</title>
    <comment>The word to describe this dvd is, INTENSE! I had to go see this awesome band in concert to prove to myself that the band I saw on this dvd was real and not lipsynched or studio created. To be brutally honest, they were even better! This dvd takes place on their "Screaming For Vengence" tour. I love this dvd! This is quite a find. I originally bought this on VHS, which right now has probably liquified and evaporated from the extreme heat that K.K.Downing and Glenn Tipton generated from their guitars. For this price, this is a sweet heart of a deal, I paid $30.00 for it on VHS back in '84...</comment>

    <title>The little flick that could!</title>
    <comment>What a lovely film! Kind of like Northern Exposure meets Napolean Dynamite. Jay Baruchel is for sure a rising star and it was refreshing to see Alexis bledel NOT doing a Gilmore Girl redux. Schuyler Fisk is also amazing and sings her music beautifully in the movie. The soundtrack was very impressive with interesting choices that spanned a qide variety of genres. Spot On! I would recommend this film for sure, it's one of those indie films that slipped under the radar onlt to be re-discovered by the masses. Check it out~!</comment>

    <title>Finally! Thanks Mick!</title>
    <comment>Finally, Mick Foley releases what I (rabid wrestling fan) consider to be the best hardcore dvd set , Right here in Best Buy.com (cheap pop). What can you say about a wrestler who sacrifices his well being everytime he steps in the squared circle? Reckless? Guy needs help? No, he knows what he's doing...Read any of his books? This guy is what KISS, The Beatles and Al Snow is to Rock and Roll. In this dvd set, he pulls us into his dark world and tries to explain the conceptions of famous matches that involved his alter egoes Cactus Jack, Mankind and Dude Love. Syblish ( that's a play on Syble of Sally Field fame) as it may seem, he did put booties in the seats with them everytime. Loved this set of matches! Again, Thanks Mick!</comment>

    <title>Good Game</title>
    <comment>Its a fun game that I enjoyed. The story line starts out in Dead mans chest and is a little different from the actual movie but basically follows it. The fighting is fun and a good adventure, but the camera does get in the way at times, which gets frustrating. I loved how you can play not only Jack but other characters too. I think that they could have done a better job with the game, but i was satisfied with it. But overall i think its a fun game, that you should try out. The only way to know if you like it is to try it out urself.</comment>

    <title>Great Product, just wish I had found it sooner.</title>
    <comment>When I moved to my new house I did not set up my surround sound because my living room wasn't set up well to run wires all over. So I went four LONG months using the speakers from my tv as my only sound source. (I had to play the Halo 3 Beta without surround sound.) I considered buying a new surround sound package from Sony that had wireless rear speakers, or buying a Bose surround system then purchasing their optional wireless receiver that can be connected to the rear speakers but I really wanted to keep the current Klipsch speakers I already had and this product lets me do that. Now I can enjoy all of my Xbox 360 games and DVDs in surround sound without having a mess of wires running across my living room. I've had the Rocketfish wireless rear speaker kit now for 4 weeks and I can't tell any difference in the sound quality from when I had the speakers wired to my receiver, to now with them being wireless. I would highly recommend this product to anyone and now I can't wait to hear how Halo 3 will sound in 5.1 Dolby Digital.</comment>

    <title>music that's good</title>
    <comment>some music is easy to put down and some isn't ... some albums have something about them to where you always want more or hope that that artists next album is similar and just as good if not better. each song connects and can be played in its entirety over and over... this isnt the best album on the planet but the lyrics with tunes and melody's go really well together. its a light rock emo feel. ...</comment>

    <title>Most Boom for the Buck</title>
    <comment>Did quite a bit of research for outdoor speakers for my rear deck. Read lots of reviews for similar speakers ("dual") offered at a competing store. But found only one review for these. So I went to several stores and quickly found that the higher-priced offerings really did not sound as good the two competeing lesser-priced options available. Ultimately - the Insignias beat-out the Duals easily. They sounded cleaner, didn't have the tinny high-end, and handled mid-bass signifcantly better than did the duals! (for this size, deep bass is a bit too much to expect) The Insignias look great, were very simple to install using the included wall-brackets, and sound amazing. Obviously you should always listen to speakers before you buy, but I can't imagine choosing any other small outdoor speaker over these - nothing compares for $50 or $300!</comment>

    <title>Whalen Flat Panel TV Stand</title>
    <comment>This stand is Great!! I just put it together last night and it looks much better than the others out there. I felt the wood accents would complement my interior more and it worked out well. The construction may take some time but this is very sturdy. I used the suspended and rotating panel mount option. Made of mostly metal and bolts(no tools needed, it comes with 2 wrenches) but held my 42" with ease. I would definitely recommend.</comment>

    <title>Amazing Experience</title>
    <comment>Ok right from the get go this isn't like your standard anime. It doesn't have any gitty dumb girls showing their goods or horrible voice acting. The main character Guts takes you in and you feel as though your him for this whole experience. the voice acting is superb, the best ive watched besides a myozaki movie. This anime had such an impact on me, this is the reason i started watching anime. If you haven't seen it buy it now! dont wait cause if you are an anime fan you ARE missing out.</comment>

    <title>Super Intense Movie</title>
    <comment>I rented this movie on Netflix after getting some info on it on an IFC documentary regarding Indie Rex (replace the R with S for real word). I have to say this movie is very intense yet not very graphic. Ellen Page was unbelievably good as was Patrick Wilson and deserve any acting awards possible. The movie is rather claustrophobic in an occassionally psychadelic way as most of it takes place in "Jeff's" house (with differnet brightly colored walls)except for the initial Coffee shop and the final scenes. I don;t want to give away any of the plot so I am going to just say 5/5 stars and a great movie. Depending on your preteen or teenager this maybe ok for them but screen first.</comment>

    <comment>This game is loads of fun and the sixaxis controls make you feel like you're there. I'll admit the controls are a bit weird at first, but once you complete the training missions a few times you really get the hang of it and love it. The graphics are sick @ 1080 HD resolution and the sound is amazing. Personally I think the ground attacks are the most fun where you can put an entire legion on fire, slap 'em around, and feed on soliders in slow motion. Get this game!</comment>

    <comment>I remember watching this on the Disney channel with my children when they were little. It is a timeless treasure. It takes you gently back to a simpler time. You can't help but fall in love with the characters. The story lines are not too adult for youngsters and not too boring for adults. I look forward to sharing these with my grandchildren when they come along.</comment>

    <title>Don't Plug In Without It</title>
    <comment>If you want a showroom picture and peace of mind as far as power surges go...buy this unit. My HD picture is fantastic, video games are awsome and just knowing that my investment is protected is worth the price. I live in an area where thunderstorms are common place, day or night, 24/7, so when I'm away, or a sleep, I feel secure knowing that my entertainment investment is in good hands.</comment>

    <title>One For The Fans</title>
    <comment>I know most people don't like video game movies and they just bash it before even watching it this movie actually wasn't bad i would say its up there with the first mortal kombat game but only if u know the Dead or Alive franchise if u have no idea who or what the game is about then i would recommend watching it like the title said it is one for fans if u love the game u will like the movie if u don't then don't bother the action is good and fast paced like in the game not all the characters are in the movie sorry to say but all in all it is a good movie definitly recommend it to fans of DOA</comment>

    <title>Waste of Time</title>
    <comment>If you are not fluent in spanish, or are not looking for a visual book pass on this. I thought my tv was screwed up and spent 10 minutes trying to find the alt audio button on the dvr. I wasted precious minutes of my life that I will never get back hoping that maybe english would kick in eventually. IT NEVER DOES, YOU HAVE TO READ CAPTIONS IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE STORY. Call me a movie snob, but our films get recorded in other languages, I find it hard to believe that a movie with such good reviews has no english language audio track...Heres to the hope that this movie fails and winds up in the 99 cent bin at the car wash.</comment>

    <title>Enjoyment for fans of both franchises</title>
    <comment>I feel Like FvsJ was a battle between two heavyweight fighters. At the end I said "the fight was as pretty good, but I wish it were a little better." As I feel with many horror movies these days I wish the feel of the movie had been a little creepier. This movie had too much of a rock and roll feel to it. Although making this movie frightening was pretty much impossible because as time goes on, it seems that Freddy Krueger has become the master of the one liner. Jason Voorhees' appearance in this movie could also have been a little more frightening. He looked as if he had been dabbling into the latest diet craze.</comment>

    <title>Even die hard fans will agree...Pure Trash!</title>
    <comment>Simple and straight to the point, this movie was by far the worst in the franchise. This movie should not even be taged as horror, the only horrifying part of this movie is the plot. Jason in space, what a complete utter mistake! The only part of this movie I enjoyed was the two minute flashback to Crystal Lake. Other than that this movie should be erased from the history of Friday the 13th!!</comment>

    <title>I'm Impressed.</title>
    <comment>OK, let me do a track by track review of this album. I have listened to this tens of hundreds of times in the past month, and I have hardly listened to anything else, which is unusual for me, but I guess I couldn't listen to anything else. This was the else. OK, bad jokes aside, here we go. 1. I'm Impressed: this is the track that got me interested in the band after hearing them perform it on Late Night With Conan O'Brien. Not the best performance, but I knew had something. When I heard the album version, I was blown away. It is really a great song. Lots of underlying instruments that keep you interested at every listen. 2. Take Out The Trash: The first few time I heard this, I thought it was horrible. The vocals in a few places were so out of tune, it wasn't even funny. But, I listened to it long enough once to hear the bridge, and that was enough to get me into the song. Very good bass line there. 3. Upside Down Frown: I really like this one. Nice drum track in there. 4. Climbing The Walls: Originally one of my favorite track on the album, but after a while, I got tired of the intro with just his voice, and flipped past it. 5. Careful What You Pack: This is a good one. I really like it. The chorus on the voice, and the little synth bits make this one very good. 6. The Cap'm: I really like this one, but there is not much I can say to explain why. 7. With The Dark: Wow. This is a great one that jumped out at me listening to this. The vocals, the harmony, everything is spot on. 8. The Shadow Government: Now, this track was alittle annoying at first with the double echo on his voice, but the chorus changed my Mind with it's alternating drum track on all the choruses, and the harmony between the two vocals. 9. Bee Of The Bird Of The Moth: I like the melody in the song. It is enough to make you keep listening. 10. Withered Hope: I didn't like this one at first either, but once again, the chorus sold me with the rapid tempo, and great vocal harmonies. 11. Contrecoup: I loved this song. Very good lyrics, on a simple subject matter if you know what the words mean. Before I looked them up, I had no idea what it was about at all. 12. Feign Amnesia: This is a good track. On the line "things that are half new" when that backing synth kind of kicks in, that is what hooked me. 13. The Mesopotamians: Not the best track on the album, but still a good one. All and all, this is a great album.</comment>

    <title>Mario's now a board game</title>
    <comment>This is a cleaver twist to your everyday board game. The mini-challenges keep the game interesting, while testing your Wii remote skills. Being able to team up with your child is a great option rather than throwing a game for the sake of a behavioral meltdown. All and all, this game holds my interest for hours.</comment>

    <comment>This was one of the best movies I've seen recently. The cinematography was gorgeous, and the subtitles were perfectly timed so you could read them and appreciate the visuals as well. It can be brutal and gory, but is also beautiful, I recommend it highly!</comment>

    <title>By far the best halloween sequel</title>
    <comment>I really enjoyed Halloween II. I thought it was really clever how the sequel took place literally after the first one just ended. I think this is the third best halloween installment right after Rob Zombie's recent "reimagining."</comment>

    <comment>So order online pick up at store, waitied 20 mins and then find out thats its be opened before, no biggie i can return it if i chose to. The quality of hdtv signals i pick up is amazing. I recommend this for people who have an HDTV with built in turner all new tvs have it , and people who do not want to go the cable route due to cost . I picked up 6 local hdtv stations. Fox CBS ABC, PBS CWHD NBC. Prime time in HD for free. However tv picture didn't fare so well for analog signals. Mainly snow</comment>

    <title>Amazing Film</title>
    <comment>A beautiful, elegant story that takes you into the mind of a small child with outstanding visual effects. It not only captures authenticity of the era and location, but it also shows you culture and life in other countries and other time periods. I am not fluent in Spanish. I don't speak a word of it, but with English subtitles, you almost forget its in another language. The movie is like Alice in Wonderland meets A Beautiful Life. It mixes warfare and imagination with an unforgettable plot. It's worth every penny.</comment>

    <title>Must have accessory</title>
    <comment>first i don't know why it says pre-order on the website, with a ship date for mid october. they had them at my local best buy. this chat pad is a must have for anyone who sends messages on the 360. it snaps right onto the controller &amp; doesn't mess up the feel of the controller. also the the back light feature of keys is great. it lights only when sending messages.</comment>

    <title>Grindhouse: Death Proof = pure fun</title>
    <comment>although it isnt fair that grindhouse was split to two DVD's. the movie still stands alone strong. It is extremely fun to watch. The characters are lovable. Dialogue is real and believable. Definitely worth a DVD purchase. The plot is amazing as it basically brings back the old B movies. Buy this movie. You wont be sorry.</comment>

    <title>Open wide</title>
    <comment>Open your mind,open your eyes, because this movie is one of those docs that will have you wide open. Some material is not suitable for younger adults NC-17. It takes you on a inside look of the movie and the star Linda Lovelace,and crew's life. And why deep throat was one of, if not the best xxx movie of all time. If you like docs about xxx this one is the one to get.</comment>

    <title>Wonderful unit</title>
    <comment>I upgraded to this unit after I outgrew the 8-port gigabit switch I had. This unit runs great, and has lots of room for me to grow. I would recommend this to anyone that needs more than 8 ports for their home/office and need them to be GigaBit. One thing to keep in mind though, because it is gigabit and does have 24 ports on it, it does have a pretty powerful CPU. As a result it does have a fan, but this device belongs in a server room or telco closet anyways, not on your desk. Its not really loud, but its got a high pitch fan, where as a PC has a larger lower pitched fan. Just something to consider.</comment>

    <title>Not Worth Buying!</title>
    <comment>25% game, 75% cut scenes. There are way to many cut scenes, it gets really annoying really fast. The graphics are awesome but the controller controls are really bad. If you still want to buy this game just rent it and you will glad you took my advice.</comment>

    <title>Great Game IFFF it didn't Freeze</title>

    <title>Just an outstanding movie</title>
    <comment>I was a big fan of the cartoon when I was growing up and I think it's a really awsome switch from cartoon to big screen. And the special affects were on my opinon flawless to see a vehicle change like that and it looked real it's a very MUST HAVE all editions</comment>

    <title>Greatest Show</title>
    <comment>This is one of the best shows on television. It has everything, drama, comedy, romance. One minute you can be laughing your head off and the next the tears are just pouring down your cheeks. The characters are some of the most relatable people on t.v. something that you just don't find much of anymore. They have "real people" problems and "real people" emotions. And the greatest part is that it's set in a hospital which just opens it up to so many different kinds of stories that you just can't get if set anywhere else. I highly reccomend this show to anyone who is sick of reality tv (who needs to watch reality tv, just get up every morning and start living to have reality) and is looking for a show to just watch while relaxing and trying to escape reality, even if it's only for an hour.</comment>

    <title>Great Album</title>
    <comment>Without a doubt this was the best album of 2004 and easily ranks as one of the best albums I've ever purchased. Their next album Black Holes and Revelations is extremely good but not quite up to this level. I recommend buying them both at the same time.</comment>

    <title>Best Wireless Router</title>
    <comment>After years of dealing with unreliable Linksys equipment, I purchased this router and the compatible receiver antennas. This router provides at least 5 times the speed I have had in the past, but more important, the range is markedly increased. It was simple to set up, easy to encrypt if you want to, and so far has provided consistent, fast, wide ranging access to my Cable broadband internet.</comment>

    <title>Jay's Best</title>
    <comment>Jay-Z never made another album this good. Matter of fact I think as far as Hip-Hop goes only one other album is as good or better and that's Illmatic. Remarkable album. Great word play on every track, (you have to really listen to what he's saying). "The percentage who don't understand is larger than the percentage who do. Ask yourself what percentage is you?" Really. Ask yourself. Don't just skim through the album or you'll miss a lot. Plus with Biggie on a track it has one of the best rap duos of all time. "Regrets" is one of the best songs on the album but you can't pick your favorite. It's nearly impossibe. One of the most important differences between Jay now and then is the fact that you could hear the conviction in his voice then. Every thing he said carried weight. He made you want to listen more. Now he whispers all the time and it makes his message sound weak even if it should mean something. No such problems in "Reasonable Doubt". If Nas didn't kill it in '94 Jay finished it off in '96.</comment>

    <title>Worth a rent</title>
    <comment>I agree with a previous review that there is way to many cut scenes, I would be getting into one of the battles and then comes another cutscene. The cutscenes before and after the actual mission look absolutely amazing though. Some people say that the missions are repetative, which they kind of are, but they do keep you interested in what is going on. Controls have also been debated about and once you get the hang of it, they arent so bad (especially with the help of the new firmware update, 1.92). All in all, it was a great idea but didnt completely impress or satisfy me the way I thought it would. Worth the rent though.</comment>

    <title>Xbox 360 Messenger Kit</title>
    <comment>Purchased Item in store, great item well worth the 29.99. Also Great for the guys with BIG HANDS and the controller seems a bit small, this adds some size to the hand grips. Husband liked the feel of it, and myself, You really can't even tell it's there while playing. Messaging is much faster, and more accurate. Back Lite is great for playing in dim to no light. Overall a great item, however it doesn't work well with the gel skins, but those can be trimmed so that it fits around the keypad.</comment>

    <title>Great Purchase</title>
    <comment>After the first time my batteries ran out mid-game, I went to the store and bought this. So far, it's great. I agree with the other reviewer that you have to wiggle the controller around to make sure the charger is making contact, but it's worth it. Saves money on AAs, cuts down on battery pollution, and the rubber grips are actually pretty nice. I'm recommending this to everyone I know with a Wii.</comment>

    <title>A Vague Experience</title>
    <comment>I played through this game, sacrificing around 30 or 40 hours. I didn't buy it, but rented it, I recommend "renting" it. The beginning introduction is not something grand, it's boring, so basically I just skipped it. The game doesnt give you a name, you can't name your character, character costumization is horrible; does give you a couple of traits to toy around with, but not enough to change the aspect of the whole character. Graphics: The game has "somewhat" of a nice landscape, not the best, it does have its moments, but overall quality is not there. If you're expecting lush landscapes extravagent detail, you wont find it here. Armor is nice, but its blocky. Character animation is disgusting, blocky characters, they don't even move their fingurs, voice acting is just bad, overall. Weapons are cool, but just because the weapons have awesome effects it doesnt improve the bad gameplay. Exploration: Vague and unispiring. Basically you have this HUGE land and there is nothing to find. Caves are empty, enemies are repetative, same monster different color, nothing special. Seriously, I mean, I went exploring and all you get is death, spawn kill that will make you restart the game. There is nothing, I mean, NOTHING to find. No cool discoveries, no jaw-dropping puzzles, games, mini-games, caves, and enemies. Nothing at all. No sunkin ships, no watery caves, no detail at all. If they made the effort to make the game as good or better then Oblivion, this game would of been the top of the line. Gameplay: Bad, repetative, bland, horrible, boring, VAGUE!!! OMG this game combat is so boring, the magic effects are something that you'll see on a PSP... but wait a sec, PSP seems to have better animation! Overall visual effects are not there. Combat is just one small buttom mash, no depth at all. You have a shield, and you can't BLOCK! OMG I mean, come on, you have to press the "B" button to try to evade enemy attack. It's really horrible, play it to experience what games should not be. Story: Find and Fetch, go here get this, go there get that. Relic pieces from his family, nothing really captivating. You'll bore or fall asleep before you finish it. Or give up since the map is so bad, you can't tell the small dots that are on the map, is that a mision or a teleport stone? Seriously, if the dots were bigger and unbundled letters, I'd probably understand it better. Overall: This is basically a watered down version of "The Elder Scrolls: 3 Morrowind", and if you thought that game was hard, think of this one but 100x worse. The only aspect of this game I liked were the cheats, they truely are the only thing that make this game fun. Create your own weapon, make your own village, make your own NPCs, that awesome, make your own army, make a war, its fun. That's that, you'll sacrifice achievments, but do they really matter? No. So cheat, to make it FUN!</comment>

    <title>Carnival</title>
    <comment>This game was a very welcome addition to our Wii Game library. We loved the Wii Sports and Wii Play and this game has added more fun for the whole family. The Skeeball type game is great, the clown game, dunking booth, balloons and more are almost like being a a carnival but you don't have to spend a ton of money at the real games. I have even liked the side games like the one that pushes coins off a ledge to rack up tickets. It has made me want to go to Dave and Busters or MainEvent to try the real thing. I know I have an addiction but what can I say. I am a kid at heart. This game has run well for over two weeks now and has not had one issue yet. The one drawback if at all is that you can't earn tickets in the multiplayer mode. So to get tickets you have to be the only one in on the fun. Not a big problem though as once you have unlocked some of the hidden games, those show up in multiplayer mode too. I recommend this game and have played it for days now in my spare time. I have even put Madden 08 down for it but I do like my Madden. Biggs is calling now too but I know that Carnival will be a game that is played a great deal of Wii Time.</comment>

    <comment>I like 50 better than Kanye. Kanye is weird. I have the album already. More than half of the album is listen worthy. My favorite song is "All Of Me" with Mary J. 50 makes good girl songs. I will support him and go buy the real album.</comment>

    <comment>This usb nightmare has gripped not only me I'm sure, for when I try to give her the boot, she only lets me down. she comes with an incompatible disk, unaproved by xp and therfore not downloadable on my worthless 5 year old piece of history- dell 2400, which i have wasted vast sums of moola on to no avail. Why pray tell, would one expect an upgrade for the garbageware which doesn't work that came with the garbage in the hard to open plastic ? One wouldn't. As no downloads are available to anyone from witchy-poo (M.S.), dynex with a small "d" ( Disributed by the lovely Best Buy, which i own stock in )(embarrassingly) Oh how the mighty have fallen. It's service, my boys. and if you don't provide for it, you are doomed to fail. boo!!!!! (wake up)chowie</comment>

    <title>All hype, no game</title>
    <comment>This supposed talk about the game handling better since the firmware update on the PS3 doesn't change the fact that the game has VERY poor controls. Sony has stated that the game was designed for the "casual" gamer... shaking the controller for 2 minutes straight is not casual, and it's not a game at that point. Among my family, none of us (mother, two brothers and a sister) were able to consistently get the dragon to speed up without suddenly turning 180 degrees the wrong way... exactly what we DIDN'T want to do. That game is pretty, and honestly does a good job with the storyline, for the type of game that it is. However, there is no excuse for shipping a broken game. They shouldn't have to make a patch for the game (and have that patch come out a week later) for it to work better; honestly, we still can't tell the difference between before the firmware update and after the firmware update: the game still controlls horribly. Bottom line: pretty game that is frustrating to play, if you want your controller actions to actually affect what's happening on the screen.</comment>

    <title>Not A Bad first movie for Cena</title>
    <comment>I saw this in theaters and I gotta say it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I got this for a b-day gift from a friend I was satisfied Even if you don't watch The WWE You might still get a couple of Chuckles. I'd say Rent or what the heck. Buy if it's only $10 bucks. If you like movies with cheesy punch lines or a fan of the mystery science theaters. Then you will like this one. :)</comment>

    <title>A Great Addition!</title>
    <comment>The chatpad is light and comfortable to the feel. The keys are backlit, and you can actually see them in the dark. There is an interactive friends icon on the keyboard that allows you to chat with a friend while playing a game, and does not bring up the larger messemger/chat blade. A smaller window pops up and allows the user to easily chat without pausing a game. This is one of the better accessories Microsoft has released, as long as you use text/MSN feature of the Xbox 360. I picked one up for the whole family!</comment>

    <title>MHF2</title>
    <comment>OK, so first off if you have ever played monster hunter on PS2 and MHF on PSP, and actually liked it, then prepare to get blown away, this installment of MH is the best one yet, so many new features compared to the one on PS2, and PSP, if you want a good MH game then get this one.</comment>

    <title>Great Blu-Ray disc</title>
    <comment>Very cool Blu-Ray disc of Letters of Iwo Jima.Very nice 1080 picture and a great surround sound-The battle scenes are all around you. Also the movie is realy good.Clint Eastwood knows how to make great movies.I also have the companion piece Flags of Are Fathers-do note Flags of Are Fathers was released on Blu-Ray by Dreamworks as Letters from Iwo Jima was released on Blu-Ray by Warner,and as Dreamworks has ditched Blu-Ray for HD DVD Flags of are Fathers will soon be gone from store shelfs,so if you have yet purchase Flags of Are Fathers on Blu-Ray and I have been thinking about buying it make sure to get it now.</comment>

    <title>Awesome fun</title>
    <comment>Takes you back to when you were young. Games are not impossible but as difficult if it was a real carnival game. As you play you unlock prizes like outfits. Tons of fun, dress up like a monkey, or wear your "BLING" necklace. Everyone will have fun playing this.</comment>

    <title>BEST PURCHASE EVER</title>
    <comment>I really love this album it's one of his best....50 Cent is a very talented individual. He's very original and some people may think that he raps about the same stuff but to me it's all original. I would recommend this product to all even if you don't like rap. People can say what they want about 50 Cent but that's why he's making the big money and you ain't got none. He will continue to out sell any one who steps in his way from laughing straight to the bank. hahahahahaha</comment>

    <title>Favorite Show (Just behind 24...)</title>
    <comment>Great show with a great story. The author of the book this show is based on does an awesome job of incorporating his experiences into the show. Each show has an awesome "moral" to it and it's a smart show. I enjoy shows that "fool" me. You think one thing is going to happen or you are led to think one thing but in turn is something totally different but better. Plenty of action and the actors are great. Can't get enough of it!</comment>

    <title>the departed review</title>
    <comment>When I began watching the departed I had extremely high hopes for the movie( what with the incredible cast) and when I finished I have to say I was not dissapointed. It is in my opinion that Jack Nicholson's portrayel of legendary crime boss Frank Costello was one of his best performances to date, but I guess that is to be expected from an amazing actor such as himself. This all-star cast kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire picture, and the ending had me leaving on a high note. For those reasons I give this film a two thumbs up, and strongly recommend it to anyone.</comment>

    <title>Better than Dallas</title>
    <comment>I just spent the last few days watching this series and it's completely consuming!! It's the Dallas of the new millennia but better!! Although I didn't watch it as a purchase because Season One won't be released for another 10 days from this posting (Release date: Sept 18th), I plan to purchase a copy for myself and one for my mother!! It's worth every single penny and more!!!</comment>

    <title>Early Groundbreaking British Sci from the 70's</title>
    <comment>I first discovered this amazing series on cable television in the early eighties.At that time cable was VERY NEW! Nickelodeon had just started and The Tomorrow People were their science fiction show. This show never failed to deliver clean entertainment . Mind you it was never boring either! I'm so glad that after all this time it's finally out on dvd. I can share this series with my children and not have to worry about swear words or improper situations. This is a safe show! In today's climate, this show is an oddity.Get this before the word get's out!</comment>

    <title>A high-quality game</title>
    <comment>This is one of the best games I've played on any console! The graphics are astounding even on a standard defenition TV, the music is worthy of being played in the world's best symphony halls and the story is deep and compelling (and draws parallels to Europe during the Black Plauge). Gameplay is fast and intense. You quickly lose track of time as you soar over amazingly detailed battlefields and the action does not let up. The use of the SIXAXIS controller does present a learning curve. But after a few minutes of playing I found the control setup made perfect sense and in a short while becomes intuitive. I am not using the 1.92 system, but after a few minutes of gameplay I was able to make my dragon do what I wanted when I wanted with few if any problems. Great graphics, lots of action, outstanding music, and an innovative control set-up. A brilliant game!</comment>

    <title>Major disappointment</title>
    <comment>I was excited for the release of this game moreso than any game yet. However, when I popped the game in my console, I was very disappointed. As mentioned earlier, the controls are very poor and it is extremely difficult to control your dragon. In addition, the scenarios seem to be the same thing over and over. With as much hype as this game received, it bombed bigtime...they should've delayed the release even longer as this game had alot of potential.</comment>

    <title>If you need coasters go to Wal-Mart</title>
    <comment>I purchased these a while back, at first I just thought they were bad discs because my DVD Burner in my desktop would only burn them to 50% then spit them out. So I took them back and exchanged them. Again, my burner still burns them to 50%. When it does burn them to the 50%, I only get a 2.4x burn speed. My laptop will burn them but it is extremely slow, again 2.4x. The 8x advertised on the label may work with some other kind of burner. My desktop burner is a Sony 810A. I have purchased Verbatim DL's in the past and they are awesome. So, if you are looking for some coasters for your coffee table, you'll get plenty from these. Waste of money, stay away from these discs!!!</comment>

    <title>Yay for CSI</title>
    <comment>I really just got into the show and have purchased the first 3 Seasons from Best Buy. I have watched all the Law and Order SVU seasons on DVD and needed something else since I watch most of my television very late at night. So I picked this up....and how happy I am. This show is so awesome and by the third season the episodes get a lot more interesting and a lot more detailed. And once I finish one season I can go right over to Best Buy and pick up the next one because they usually always have it in stock which is terrific. If you are into crime drama this show is definitely worth picking up!</comment>

    <title>Whatever happened to common sense?</title>
    <comment>"Who Killed the Electric Car" is a short documentary about the electric car and its technology and their disappearance from the roads. While the film itself does not make a strong case through the presentation of statistics or "expert opinions," it does appeal to common sense. In a way, the rise and fall of the electric car is a strange kind of "conspiracy." It all happened to so fast that very few people seem to even remember the technology involved or the cars themselves. The most telling part about the story is how odd it was that after the lease on the electric car was up, every last one of them was rounded up and none of the people who had leased one even had the option to buy or renew. A viewing of this film will really make one think about how our country works. The whole market just imploded. With all of the noise being made about Hydrogen fuel cells and ethanol, I can't help but think that there was already a viable solution out on the market. Maybe it was too viable.

    <title>Another Great Purchase!</title>
    <comment>Once again, Will &amp; Grace didn't disappoint us! Season 6 was another laugh a minute season. The antics of Karen and Jack and the noticable weight gain of Debra Messing with her real-life pregnancy made for rich television comedy!</comment>

    <comment>I love these ear buds...the price makes them very affordable and I find the sound as good or better than some more expensive brands I've used. And the colors are great!</comment>

    <title>Their best effort yet</title>
    <comment>This album is their most accomplished work yet. I didn't love every single track but 505, Fluorescent Adolescent and Brianstorm are destined for a greatest hits collection from this band some day when they are old enough to have one. The CD is worth it just for those 3 excellent songs and you get a bunch others which are pretty good as well. They may not be as hyped as they were a year ago but they've never been better.</comment>

    <comment>I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago, and I love it. I would recommend this product to anybody who needs a lightweight but very roomy camera bag, I have a Sony camera and it fits perfect. along with other things (charger, memory card, usb) I plan on using this bag for a long time!! Its very durable and also fits my video camera and extra tapes! Hope u enjoy it as much as i do!</comment>

    <title>Better than the last.</title>
    <comment>Although MCR tends to be a little over produced for my liking, the band still manages to sound fairly real on this album. This album is a little more emo than the last couple, but it still rocks. The track "Mama" is probably my favorite. They sprinkle small amounts of message in their music, but not so much that the listener chokes on it. Music is the focus, message is the afeter dinner mint. Overall, a fantastic album. Probably the best I have heard this year.</comment>

    <title>Computer use only!</title>
    <comment>I used up several of these Memorex discs trying to burn a DVD that would play on my Sony DVD/VCR player. While they worked perfectly in playback on my computer, playback on the DVD player was very poor. The beginning of each disc played well, but quality degraded as the disc progressed until it would finally freeze up. I tried 3 different videos, so the problem was not my file. A different brand DL disc (and one of only two brands that I will rely on from now on!) worked perfectly on all machines. I'll use these up for storing material that I will play back on my computer (although I can't vouch for longterm viability), but if you're looking for DVDs that will work on a player connected to your TV, save your money.</comment>

    <title>Outstanding Scout Movie</title>
    <comment>This is probably the Best Movie about Scouts that I've ever seen. The Performaces by Fred McMurry and Kurt Russell are both outstanding as are the performances of all of "Lem's Boys". I highly recomend this movie, as both a Family Movie and a Feel Good movie for when you need a boost in your spirits. In my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.</comment>

    <title>solid grinder</title>
    <comment>I purchased a $75 Krupp coffee grinder @ W.&amp; Sonoma and it lasted 7 months before it quit. In a fit of anger and in an emegency purchase I went to Best Buy and replaced the Krupp with a Cuisinart. It's solid and dependable...doesn't have all the bells and whistles...but I like it.</comment>

    <comment>the lens is great, works fine, zooms in good.... two problems no stabilization so you have to use a tripod and the bigger problem is that for a little bit more money you can purchase the next lens up and get a real telephoto zoom lens this one is good for beginners</comment>

    <title>Superb Microwave - Superb price</title>
    <comment>Hard to believe you can get 2.0 cubic feet of space and great preformance in a microwave with this kind of price. Its features are bountiful and it does an excellent job of cooking and defrosting. The room is plentiful and the rotating platform helps to get things done evenly. We believe it to be the best priced microwave of its kind for this kind of preformance and Best Buy has the best prices on it.</comment>

    <title>Excellent, but not without constraints</title>
    <comment>Pros: Comfortable backlit keys, slightly concave keyboard face is ergonomic, excellent build material, snaps on and does not shake at all, nicer controls on the included new headphones, does not obscure natural grip of gamepad, is as natural and comfortable as any thumbpad can get. Cons: Tight snap-on fit means harder removal or sratched srewholes on the pad from repeated removal, no " key, cannot actually input messages as fast as you type due to a slight lag in the 360 processing the input and letters are often dropped (*but this is a problem on the console's side rather than the chatpad) Bottomline: Essential for anyone who ever uses the Live Messenger functions on the 360. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Great Product! Great Buy!</title>
    <comment>I use this ink in my printer and I found out I could order it on-line and save lots of money. If you order two you get 25% off the 2nd one with free shipping. To me this is a win-win situation. Now I have it on hand and don't have to worry about running out of ink and the most inoportune time. Since I use more color ink than black it just made sense to have some handy. As always the quality is great and the service as well. Great!!</comment>

    <title>You'll love these!</title>
    <comment>I've always found Verbatim blank media to be reliable and that's definitely the case with their 50 pack DVD+R's. I have used these for years and RARELY have a coaster. (I can say that about other brands.) Transfer is clean and audio is clear. Verbatim may cost a little more than other brands, but the difference in quality and reliability is worth the extra pennies per DVD. You won't be disappointed!</comment>

    <title>Not greatest expansion pack ever</title>
    <comment>I bought Bon Voyage yesterday and I was slightly dissapointed in the places you could go. The community lots left a lot to be desired in some places, at least in the ocean vacation. There didn't seem to be enough to do and the food never changed from community lots. I enjoyed learning the cultural dances and the tour guides. This is still a good buy, just may require some additions to get this to be a full game.</comment>

    <title>Great for those with knee problems</title>
    <comment>Having little cartilage left in my knees and unable to get down on them to scrub my floors, the Flip-it is the answer to my floor scrubbing problem. I am pretty fussy as to how my floor looks after I clean it and those other mops that are sold in most grocery stores just don't clean as well as this. The fact that you can see how much dirt is being removed, not just "moved around on your floor" is amazing. I am on my second Flip it and it has become one of those gifts that my kids have given me on those special holidays where they just don't know what to get me.</comment>

    <comment>This is a great freezer! I love that it is on wheels and can be easily moved around. I live in a rural area and occassionally lose power during a storm and have not had to throw out food with this freezer. The seal around the lid is tight, yet easily opened by my daughter. The included tray is deep, and there is also a built-in shelf.</comment>

    <comment>This is by far the best concert footage that I can remember watching and enjoying time after time.......What a beautiful tribute to an amazing artist that somehow did not always get his dues.....Ravi Shankar and his daughter produced a moving tribute to their friend George with an orchestra that impresses......By the time George's rock 'n roll friends take the stage, they sing-- note for note-- songs of George's that bring back the magic,,,as "Uncle" Ringo", then "Uncle" Paul, make their way on stage it is so moving that I can only imagine how it felt to be there in Royal Albert Hall,,,I can't spoiled the moments...just get this DVD and sit back (if you can) and enjoy...again..and again...and again.....THANK YOU all, esp. Jeff Lynne and Eric Clapton for helping Dhani and Olivia Harrison do this tribute one year later........</comment>

    <title>Nachoooooooooooooooooo!!</title>
    <comment>Some (my wife included) may find Jack Black quite annoying. But to many (myself included), he's just funny. He obviously goes for the cheap laugh, and this family comedy (yep, my 4 year old daughter loves it, and insisted I buy this DVD) is well worth purchasing. It's perfect for everyone, those who love hip new comedies, like Napoleon Dynamite (directed by Jared Hess, who also directed this), those who love flatulence jokes, those who love Mexican wrestling, those who love overweight friars, those who love to laugh. The DVD includes a ton of bonus features, including my fave, a behind-the-scenes look at Black creating the song he sings about midway through the film. Funniest part of the movie. Highly recommended DVD. Watch it with your 4-10 year old kids, they'll love it!</comment>

    <title>The best yet? No...no...no...Yes!</title>
    <comment>If you loved the Vicar of Dibley series, then you must have a copy of this DVD! Continuing the story of Vicar Geraldine Granger's (Dawn French, of the French &amp; Saunder's fame,) life in the town of Dibley is a blessing indeed! Full of the usual madness of the cast of characters; Jim Trot, Alice and Hugo, David Horton, Frank Pickle, and Owen Newitt, these episodes deliver everthing an old fan, and a newcomer, would enjoy again and again. The episodes "Christmas" and "New Year", are full of guest-star cameos, and great and hilarious writing. The DVD also has some extras that are a great addition to the whole of the Dibley Anthology. You don't have to be learned in the older episodes of "The Vicar" to enjoy any of these bits, as the acting and writing are at once enjoyable, and surprisingly touching at times. Good entertainment is hard to come by these days, because this continuation of the Brit-comedy series sets the bar high indeed!</comment>

    <title>Great game to play with kids</title>
    <comment>Carnival Games is similar to Wii Play -- it's a selection of mini games that you might encounter when at a local fair. There are 30+ games to enjoy, including a dunk tank, skee ball, the clown balloon game, shooting gallery and so forth. The games are easy to learn and straight forward. With my six year old, the games are even more fun. He loves the game and it's great for me because the games are quick and we can enjoy them together. This game isn't for the Bioshock crowd, but if you can appreciate a quick pick up and play experience and wished you could play those carnival games all year round, this is for you.</comment>

    <title>Not what I expected</title>
    <comment>I bought this headset in order to give me the opportunity to hear better and speak more clearly. The headset does accomplish this, however, when I want to let others hear the conversation the plug and play option is not very friendly. Unplugging the headset does not allow me to immediately hear and speak through the computer. I usually have to get out of the website and back in and it often does not work well. It takes a couple of times to get it working correctly again. The same is true in the other direction, that is, one cannot just plug in the headset and begin speaking and listening. I use SKYPE rather than MSN chat - it should make no difference to the headset, but perhaps it does. I have recently learned that for around $60, that is about $20 more than this headset, Logitech has a camera with built-in microphone and speaker that works superbly. That may be the better buy.</comment>

    <title>Great Idea, okay implementation</title>
    <comment>I haven't experienced the lock up problems that others have. Using your Miis would have been great, instead you create a character with very limited options for look. Where the options come in is winning in different games. I have played all of the games at least once. The games using the frisbee and dart controls are much more difficult because the controllers aren't designed for it. There is a coin drop game that doesn't allow you to see where the coins will be dropping from, a crucial part of the strategy in playing this style of game. There are some winners out of this, but you won't play half of the games after you've played them once, unless you're into frustration. I highly recommend the Skee ball style games, horse racing, and clown balloon blowup. They are fun alone but should be more fun in a group.</comment>

    <title>Great Family Humor</title>
    <comment>This is one of the best purchases I have made recently and that includes groceries. Even though the show is pushing thirty the humor still is funny and is a great link to my childhood. It never fails to put a smile on my face. With 4 disks of shows and the extras the Henson folks even found time to make the DVD menu entertaining to watch with shorts from favorite characters encouraging the viewer to make a selection. A must have, I can't wait until the third complete season comes out.</comment>

    <title>Great Speakers</title>
    <comment>I've had several different speaker systems hooked up to my computer systems and this is by far the best. The sound quality is amazing, what else would expect from the Bose name though? Installation was VERY easy, even the most unsavy hardware installer wouldn't have difficulty installing these speakers. I give them an A+!</comment>

    <title>Good Speakers for the Price</title>
    <comment>This set of floor speakers is actually quite powerful and robust. When searching for a set of floor speakers, I wanted something that'd work well, but that was relatively cheap. Since I didn't feel like paying up to $1,200 for floor speakers, this was a reasonable alternative. When I set them up and lit them off for the first time, I was impressed. While the bass is not earth-shattering, it is sufficient. Feel free to crank the volume without fear of loss of tone or sound quality, because they can handle it. So for personal use and small parties, I would strongly recommend considering these floor speakers.</comment>

    <title>Best Cheap all-round trimmer shaver!!</title>
    <comment>I had bought this Trimer out of sheer necessity. I was desperate for a new shaver/trimmer because the last one I had just didn't cut it for me! The trimmer works great and I really loved the stand that comes with it that allows the user to store all the attachments that come with it and it also houses the trimmer when its not in use. It is rechargeable and after the initial charge charges pretty fast. The blades are nice and sharp 4 months after I purchased and it still trims my goatee pretty smoothly. It has 14 settings that can be used to trim hair to different lengths. It has a detail trimmer that works really well too. All in all its a good multitasking product that works really well too.</comment>

    <title>Most innovative game in a long time...</title>
    <comment>If you love music, and you love to rock out, then get this game. Countless hours of "rocking" to great music, from today and yesterday (ZZ Top to Franz Ferdinand). The only downside to this games is the head-to-head mode, but they resolved that with "pro" face off in the sequel.</comment>

    <title>A Great Romantic Mucsical Comedy</title>
    <comment>First of all, Jason Buchanan of All Movie Guide, while giving the description of the movie does not seem to have seen the movie! "A professional collaboration between a popular lyricist and a washed-up musician...." Music and Lyrics is NOT about a "popular lyricist and a washed-up musician". Barrymore's character was a frustrated writer/plant-care-taker whose confidence was undermined by her college writing professor. The collaboration was pure accidental, which leads to the merry chase of trial and error in writing a song and beginning romance. Although light-hearted, there is an underlying message reminding you life is a ride--you take the chances to enjoy the ride or you can play it safe and just exist. The music is enjoyable and the rock videos reminiscent of the 80's are hysterical. As a plus, I was pleasantly surprised to witness Barrymore &amp; Grant's singing!</comment>

    <title>Awesome game!</title>
    <comment>Carnival games is really fun!! If you need a game that you just want for some good entertainment this is it. There's all kinds of games on here that are just like a real carnival! My favorites are Ski Ball, knocking over the milk jugs, and racing the horses. This game is great for all ages and a fun game to play as a group.</comment>

    <title>Very Good depiction of Jesus</title>
    <comment>Jesus of Nazareth is a very good depiction of Jesus. It starts off when Jesus is born and goes through most of his teachings and ends in the Ressurection. It is a beautiful movie and if you don't want to buy it than you could at least rent it. Just to let you know it ts about 6 hours long, but give it a chance. Highly recommend.</comment>

    <title>One of the Most Powerful Films in Recent History</title>
    <comment>Winner of the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, The Lives of Others gives in insight to the politics and machinations of the East Berlin government in 1984. Citizens are under suspicion of various crimes against the government, from helping a neighbor defect to the West to making incendiary statements that may offend high ranking officials. This movie revolves around a playwright, his famous actress girlfriend, and the official who has been sent to monitor them (for reasons that are not political). The story supplies many moments of surprise and even humour as they struggle to make the choices that will ultimately lead to their survival or their demise. The acting is brilliant, especially by Ulrich Muhe who tragically passed away in early 2007. It is a fact that many of the actors lived through ths time as artists who were faced with the same danger of being blacklisted or put in jail for the criminal act of voicing opinions. The writing is also stellar, and the ending of the film is one of the most beautiful moments on screen. I highly recommend this film.</comment>

    <title>The DVD that keeps on giving ...</title>
    <comment>One of the best TV series ever, this DVD is a great purchase as the show hits its stride. The episodes are completely re-watchable as I have already done so again and again. The more time you spend with the characters, the more you discover when revisiting them.</comment>

    <title>Crisp sound, great 5.1 effect!</title>
    <comment>The Companion 5 system includes Bose's proprietary TruSpace surround processing circuitry, which delivers a fairly convincing faux surround-sound experience from only three speakers (you get two satellites, which sit on your desk, and one "hideway" Acoustimass module--a.k.a. subwoofer--that sits on the floor and is the about the size of most similar PC speaker subs). Bose prides the Companion 5 on its easy setup--it requires you to only plug the USB connector into your computer and match up the color-coded speaker wire. There's also a small pod control (a little smaller than a hockey puck) that sits on your desk and has a headphone jack and an input for your iPod or other MP3 player. I would highly recommend this system as your digital entertainment computer solution!</comment>

    <title>Not your usual monster movie</title>
    <comment>The Host is a very unusual monster movie. The monster is awesome. The scene when it first appears is one of the best entrances I have ever seen. However, this movie is really about a dysfunctional family that gets hooked in with the monster. The direction, action, special effects and script are all outstanding. When you watch it you can decide if the monster represents the Iraq War. The movie is from South Korea and you can view it dubbed or subtitled in English (which I think is the way to go). This movie is surprisingly deep and will keep you on the edge of your seat right to the end. This is definitely a five star film and the best monster movie in years.</comment>

    <title>Best REAL Romantic Movie Ever</title>
    <comment>I purchased this for a special date on the recomendation of my best friend and she was right. This movie has so many amazing twists and storylines and on top of that it is funny as well. I really appreciate the fantastic acting and actors chosen for the role especially Alan Rickman and the cameo of Mr. Bean.</comment>

    <title>One word....Amazing</title>
    <comment>This game is amazing. I'm a college student and when I first bought it all of my roommates made fun of me, and they thought it was sooo stupid, so I made them play one game before they made fun of it anymore, and now they are hooked on the game! It probably is the most universal game out there, my parents have even played it, and they like it. With all the different levels, everyone can find a level they can play and it can still be challenging!!!</comment>

    <title>Awesome Game</title>
    <comment>I purchased this game for my son's 9th birthday. It wasn't long before I was hooked! In fact, that same afternoon I went and bought a second guitar so we could challenge each other! The whole family plays (4 kids and parents) and we each have a band to progress through the club scenes on the game. It is a great game! Good clean fun even for a mom who DOESN'T play video games!</comment>

    <title>an R&amp;B classic</title>
    <comment>There's a reason this album went DIAMOND. From the first track to the last, Usher Raymond brings heat. When you're playing this album, you shouldn't have any fear of hitting that 'shuffle' button; you know a good song will be played. 'Yeah!' was a monster hit. Usher was the first artist since the Beatles and Elvis, to have 3 singles in the Top 10 Billboard charts at the same time! That says something! This is a must-have in any R&amp;B collection...</comment>

    <title>great wireless headset</title>
    <comment>This was probably one of the best purchases my husband made. It is light weight, does not put a lot of pressure on your head and the ear covers are extrememely comfortable. The charge lasts a long time, and it covers a great distance even though from the couch to the tv is far enough. The one thing i like best, it doesn't take up a lot of space. The design is classy and the charger is small and fits in a perfect spot in our entertainment center. What you need to remember is to plug it into a surge protected outlet, in case of a bad storm. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>The Best Show Ever</title>
    <comment>The Office is hilarious. Steve Carell as Michael Scott is so outrageous and not afraid to say anything. Rainn Wilson as Dwight Schrute is the best and he needs to win the Emmy for his performance. Season 2 is probably the best season since it is before all of the extra characters were entered. I think The Office is the best show ever, even better than my other favorite Seinfeld.</comment>

    <title>Top 5 CD</title>
    <comment>This is Death Cab's best CD in what has been an outstanding career thus far. There is not a single song that I skip, which for me is saying something (I usually only like about 5-6 songs on even "good" CDs). One of the best things about this CD is the variety of songs. Unlike many bands, whose songs all sound pretty much the same, Death Cab is very versatile and they do it to perfection on this CD. Marching Bands of Manhattan, I Will Follow You Into the Dark, and Someday You Will Be Loved are all outstanding songs, but all are very different in terms of rhythm, mood, etc. This makes for a CD that doesn't get old. I'd recommend this CD to anyone who likes Death Cab, The Postal Service, any Indie Rock, or even just someone who likes newer music with great tunes and intelligent lyrics.</comment>

    <title>Good, affordable flash drive</title>
    <comment>I bought this flash drive a little over a month ago for $35.00. After exactly one month of use, it malfunctioned and became defective. I took it back to best buy and they gave me a new one and I have not had any problems since. For this size flash drive at this price, it is a great deal. I would definitely recommend this flash drive.</comment>

    <title>High Quality Modern Style</title>
    <comment>This tv stand is a great purchase for the price. Very high quality, sleek design that really accentuates a room. Recommend buying if you have black flat panel tv. Very heavy glass shelving makes set-up slightly awkward, but nonetheless it does not take a long amount of time. Would definitely recommend to anyone.</comment>

    <title>A Must Buy</title>
    <comment>This cd has all the aspects of a good album. It starts out strong with Blackest Eyes as the "single" on the cd, then interchanges between mellow and hard songs so that you are given a variety. The soft songs are gorgeous, the hard ones rock and throughout it all the artist's talent is undoubtable.</comment>

    <title>Just a few buttons short of perfect</title>
    <comment>This was to be used as a susbtitute for a wireless keyboard when the batteries went dead. Instead, it has proven itself a solid replacement. The wrist rest is padded, not hard plastic. This little addition makes it comfortable for long hours in front of a computer. The Zoom key in the middle of the keyboard is a little marvel, allowing for a larger display of a webpage or spreadsheet. It has the usual array of buttons to access volume, web browser and mail as well as the ability to set quick links to various websites or applications. The only thing this keyboard is missing are 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons using a media player. Despite this omission, I have replaced my keyboard at work and one at home with this model.</comment>

    <title>Great movie; lousy *special* edition</title>
    <comment>This is a great movie. The action is lively, the visuals are stunning. However, this 2-disc special edition was a dissapointment. The special features were weak and not very long. These features hardly warranted another disc (they could have been easily put on the regular edition.) If you're going to buy this movie (and you should), go with the cheaper regular version. Don't waste your money on this not-so-special edition.</comment>

    <title>Latest &amp; Greatest Office Pkg</title>
    <comment>I have used probably all the previous versions of MS-Office over many years, but this is the biggest change in a long time. It took a few documents to get in-step, and now, I really appreciate the improvements. Version 2007 makes it easier to create your own buttons for your most common functions and has grouped the functions in a more open fashion. I could really see the difference when I was using Excel, because I don't use it nearly as much as I use Word, and I could more easily see how intuitive the layout of the tools are. Version 2007 is more stable and the performance is better than previous versions. Files load quicker. Searching for something in one of your documents (when you don't know which one) is far easier than it used to be, also. This is the best "Office" I've seen so far.</comment>

    <title>THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME</title>
    <comment>I thought that seeing this in the IMAX theatre when it first came out was absolutly incredibly, I didn't think anything could get better than that, until i bought the Blu Ray disc from Best Buy and thought it was amazing. I can't beleive how immaculate the picture and sound was. It's insane. This movie is going to be a classic, one of the all time bests. I personally give this movie on Blu Ray 5 stars. If you haven't seen it yet, GET MOVING !! BUY IT !! It's worth owning because you will watch it again and again.</comment>

    <title>Worth every penny!</title>
    <comment>Although it's sad to see a great TV show like this end, it went out with a bang. Covering a lot more material than the first season did felt a little bit rushed, but each action-packed episode more than makes up for it. As a huge fan and student of classical history, it's very accurate, yet also made incredibly entertaining. Truly a DVD for all tastes!</comment>

    <title>Average But Fun</title>
    <comment>Upon opening the game I realized that it wasn't going to be a 100% fun. The booklet doesn't show anything in color, come on it is modern times. What you see in the booklet should somewhat represent what is on the screen. So instead of reading the book I went straight for the game. The gameplay is average at best, a bit chunky. The sideline animations are horrid, no time was put into them. There are a ton of pixelated areas found when playing such as players, field sidelines and the red zone. The commentary is ok, but Madden is hardly there and Al is no where to be found. Some of the camera angles make the game fun, but overall it's just an average title.</comment>

    <title>Fabulous for family and kids are heart</title>
    <comment>This show is fun through and through. As an adult I even enjoy watching this show a lot. It every cute and adventurous episode of season one and will be sure to keep you laughing and very entertained. If you have had a rough day, the kids have had a rough day... this is a GREAT way to sit everyone down and just have a great laugh. Some of the best characters are, of course, the imaginary friends you get a chance to meet and grow to love. Even dutchess, the mean not so cute imaginary friend, in a way you grow to appreciate her in her role. I highly recommend this show to everyone.</comment>

    <title>Cheaper modle</title>
    <comment>this unit does not hold up that good if you have to use for flash drive and plugomg camra transfere lead do not buy this modle if you want to just plug printer or scanner in and leave it pluged in it's ok. but like i said if you want 2.0 usb and you need pci card to add it buy a better model as you see the price is not much. had mine for just under two months and the one port is very loose and will not read anymore. plus get 4 port that way you have it and good ones are about 3 times the cost of this.</comment>

    <title>Good DVD, OK Movie</title>
    <comment>Considering its utter box office failure, the fact the DVD got the features it did is kind of impressive. The featurettes are alright but the movie itself is just OK. Nic Cage luckily never goes over-the-top with his performance (see: Ghost Rider and The Wicker Man) but it almost seemed like the filmmakers ran out of money or something. I guess that's to be expected after paying Cage, Julianne Moore and Jessica Biel, but surely they could have completed some of the CGI sequences (the train v. car one is painfully obvious). However, the DVD itself was fine but I'd wait for it to go on sale because while 'Next' does provide some escapistic entertainment value, I'm not sure how many times I'll actually watch it again.</comment>

    <comment>I put this as one of the funniest movies of all time. It only has one joke, but Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas pull it off so well that you will continue laughing through the whole flick. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Go Aqua Teens</title>
    <comment>I laughed, I cried... Laughed some more, cried more... A movie that is so touching, should be a must see for everyone. Old folks and kiddies will be mesmerized by the Aqua Teens.... NOT!!! Is this movie a cult classic yet? It should be. If you like Little Mermaid, All Dogs go to Heaven and that dinosaur movie series, this is probably not for you. I'd recommend this to my friends, but not all of them.</comment>

    <comment>It's everything a fan of "Firefly" and "Serenity" could want, and a blast for new fans as well. The movie itself is sweet, but the extras here, from the cool new box art to the feature-lenght cast commentary make this deluxe edition soar.</comment>

    <title>Different and worth it.</title>
    <comment>I don't know how I have missed them, but Calexico is a band with music worth hearing. It's kind of like Lou Reed meets Tom waits meets Neil Young with a postmodern medium tempo Southwest Rock/Jazz/Mariachi band. This music will grow on you and take you to a different place. It is creative, thoughtful and at times transcendent. If you liked Spoke, also check out The Black Light.</comment>

    <comment>Absolutely amazing, this one is the best on the MOH series. Realistic recoil and free starting points are just the tip of the iceberg... a little short (~8 hrs) but MP give in for re playability... highly recommended.</comment>

    <comment>This was one of the best films of Sandra bullock, you can actually see an improvement in her performance. You totally believe what shes going trough. The plot is a bit confusing at first and at the end you kind of wish it would end differently, but still a great film!</comment>

    <comment>Great CD. Loved his music and beautiful songs. His parents Alan Thicke and Gloria Loring must be so proud! I think he is going to be hotter than Justin Timberlake. He writes, sings and plays music...what an accomplished artist Robin Thicke is! This is an outstanding CD! Would recommend to anyone who loves easy listening, jazz/soul/hiphop music!</comment>

    <title>A fine thriller</title>
    <comment>This is the begining of one of the most best trilogies ever made. It is really facinating how the character bourne is totally lost and does not remember anything of his past. He is totally confused and doesnt really know who to trust, but he follows his instincts and finally gets out of the mess he is in.</comment>

    <comment>This movie is the greatest western ever made, it has a great cast of actors, Kurt Russel, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliot and a slew of other great actors. It also had some great action sequences, music score and Cinematography. The DVD has some great special features including 7 deleted scenes, all of them great. Its well worth it.</comment>

    <title>Review of Motorola SURFboard Cable Modem</title>
    <comment>This is the second Motorola Surfboard Modem I've purchased. This modem is more compact than the modem it replaced and works perfectly... right out of the box. The convenient off/on button on top of the modem is easily accessible. So, when I leave my PC for any period of time I simply press the off/on button for added security. I tend to use Best Buy for most of my electronic purchases because they will match price with other retail stores. Also, in most areas, they have a fairly broad selection of similar products to choose from. Finally, my local Best Buy staff tends to be better trained than competitive stores.</comment>

    <title>A complete kit, easily installed...</title>
    <comment>Installed in a new HP Vista based machine, work perfect. Purchased Seagate based on past experience plus the kit contained both SATA cables (data &amp; power) which WD did not (data only and local stores did not have them). -Don't use the included installation program as it can cause issues. Learn to use the Disk Management tool included in Windows (XP &amp; Vista) as this allows easy setup, partitioning and formatting. Entire process from out of box to ready to use took 15 minutes maximum. -Data transfer is quick and trouble free. Drive powers down if not used frequently (I use it file storage) but wakes for use in about five seconds when accessed. -Bonus is longer warranty than other manufacturers. A good buy overall.</comment>

    <title>easiest program ever</title>
    <comment>I love to take pictures of my family. This has helped me to take it to another level. This program lets me attach pictures, music and video into one. This is a very simple and fun product that anyone can master. It is all very self explanatory. It's step by step directions were very easy for me to create fun and long lasting memeories for my family and me. My dvd's make terrific gifts and are loved by everyone. I have really enjoyed using it and will continue to keep using it. Everyone asks me what program I used and if it was difficult to do. I tell everyone that this has been the easiest program I have ever used for making dvd's.</comment>

    <title>Definitely Worth the Buy</title>
    <comment>You can't go wrong with a cd/dvd purchase. I listen to this cd at least once or twice a week and I've had it since it was released. It's that good. It's like Alkaline Trio and Dashboard Confessional had a love child named "Bayside." If you like acoustic and deep lyrics sung with raw emotion, you have to get this cd. Then tell your friends about the cd, maybe play it in your car or room with them. Because they will want this cd. Definitely worth the buy.</comment>

    <title>GREAT Movie</title>
    <comment>I waited far too long to check this movie out. I recently saw a bit of it on TV and didn't get a chance to finish it, so I picked it up. I am so glad that I did. It is a dark movie that is disturbing in a way, but very fun to watch. I highly recommend it for anyone who feels like they want to watch a thought inducing movie. Aston Kutcher gives a great performance.</comment>

    <title>Dont waste your money!!!!!</title>
    <comment>The first piece of advice that I will suggest for this would be "Stay Away" if you choose to give it a try anyway (Because you are a die hard Transformers fan) at least rent it first and give it a try before you buy it. I rented this game and I wanted my money back, I didnt even keep it the full week of the rental! I have PS1 and PS2 games that are at least this good! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</comment>

    <comment>This is one of the most popular, challenging, and most of all fun game on the ps2. It has become so popular you can record your scores and compare them to others online. If you love games, this is one you can play for hours. This is a must have.</comment>

    <title>Compelling and fun.</title>
    <comment>Each of the four campaigns is almost like it's own Total War game that uses the Medieval II engine. If you were hoping for additions and things to the original game you'll be dissapointed, but the new campaigns are just a blast. Alot of attention was paid to the units for each faction, and there is great use of events in the two campaigns i've played so far. In the Americas campaign new factions will arrive from overseas, in Britainia William Wallace will arise, Edward will be called to the crusades for awhile and come back with renewed vigor and skill... oh and at one point England splits into two factions itself! Overall, if you love Total War games, you will LOVE this expansion.</comment>

    <title>Best PC Game</title>
    <comment>I think this is one of the best PC game hands down. If you are just starting out this is a good game to train on if you are wanting to play online games such as EVE, WOW, etc. those are games you have to play to play online. So if you are a newbie and don't know if you want to pay out monthly fees, its a good one to use to test it out. Overall its a very good game and has many characters to choose from. This is one of those games you can get lost in for hours. Once you get good with it you can also play online for free with it. I highly recommend this game especially for those just getting into the gaming world.</comment>

    <title>Always Dependable</title>
    <comment>I love my Sony CD player/Walkman. I performs very well under the stress I put it through. I always carry it on its side in a pouch. It has never skipped. I also love the lock feature, especially for carrying it in a pouch. The lock feature prevents it from turning off or changing tracks if you accidentally bump a button. Also, the remote feature is wonderful. I can put the walkman behind me and vacuum, mop, or anything I want. With the remote I do not have to take it off and take it out of its pouch in order to change tracts or turn it on or off. I love it!</comment>

    <title>Another hit</title>
    <comment>Yet another great expansion. It plays well I have had no lagging and have not seen any bugs or glitches. Bon Voyage has added some great new game play. With this pack the option to travel to many places is just a small part of it. They have added so many game play options once you get to the Vacation area that you are sure to be entertained for a long while just trying to see it all. I will not go in to details and spoil all the added fun. Just a hint that Bigfoot does exist, and treasure hunting can be fun and profitable. The addition of being able to walk to other lots now is a huge plus as is the added joy of buying and being able to add jewelry without custom content. This is truly another hit.</comment>

    <title>Light &amp; Compact for Everyday Use</title>
    <comment>I bought this for everyday cleaning to pick up dog hair and dust... the variable suction control is convenient and useful feature. It is very light, compact and can be stored away in th back of a closet. The only downside I've found is that it loses its suction relatively quickly until the bag is replaced.</comment>

    <title>dbz season 1</title>
    <comment>this box set is great for any dbz collector myself included. but the english 5.1 surround is horrible its like the japanese mono music that is 17 years old mixed with voices and sound effects from the past year in the highest quality sound. so i reccommend this to any dbz collector that loves the original japanese version. i consider this a very good bargain for 39 episodes of dbz especially since it is in hd and high quality things. i give this a 3 star for the poor job on the 5.1 version.</comment>

    <title>One Great Camera Bag</title>
    <comment>This Canon Camera bag was a real life saver on my last few vacations! It not only holds my digital camera and its batteries and gadgets, it also holds my digital camcorder. What a convenience going through airports and traveling with all my photography stuff in one bag. Its not cumbersome or bulky so it fits right in with my travel. I would recommend this bag to anyone!</comment>

    <title>Guitar Hero II and excellent addition</title>
    <comment>Guitar Hero II is an awesome addition to the original Game. Being able to play duos make the game more exciting, and much more interactive. Don't get me wrong, Guitar Hero one was a most excellent concept, and brought a way for the famous air guitarists a way to actually play along with some of the best Rock Songs ever. Then Guitar Hero II brought about the capacity to play against or with another player, and that is AWESOME! I love all the guitar hero series, and I think it will become even more popular as drums and vocals can be added to this popular game. I've never been much for video games, but I've always been an avid music fan...By introducing guitar hero to the world I have now found a venue to enjoy music and participate in some of my all-time favorite songs. Now I can be a rock star, well O.K. maybe not a real rock star...But I can think I am thanks to Guitar hero and Guitar hero II</comment>

    <title>Premonition</title>
    <comment>This movie was amazing. If you liked Memento then Premonition is right up your alley. Its a fast paced movie that makes sure you're keeping up with the action. If you miss a moment you'll lose the whole premise of the movie. Once you get to the end you understand what happened throughout the entire movie. Its a great tie in ending. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes kind of mysteries, suspense etc.</comment>

    <title>Fantastic Album</title>
    <comment>Singularity is a fantastic follow up to The Everglow. The focus on music and melodies is still present in this new album. Although a bit heavier than The Everglow or Destination: Beautiful, mae has captured their well known sound that is easily recognizable by many. If you have been looking for a new band to get into, now is the time. Check out the songs: "Brink of Disaster", "Crazy 8's", and "Rocket". You will not be disappointed.</comment>

    <title>Excellent lens</title>
    <comment>This lens is awesome. I have the D version of this lens without the vibration reduction. What a difference VR makes. I was able to get some excellent shots of my son at his high school graduation without a tripod with this VR lens and they came out extremely sharp. I have been able to get some great shots of birds at my feeder without a tripod. It seems to take sharp pictures even in low light. It is heavier than the non-VR lens but balances well with my D70. I have very small hands and have not had any problems holding the lens. It is worth the extra money for VR!!!!!!!</comment>

    <title>probably one of the best shows ever</title>
    <comment>Out of Joss Whedon's many brilliant television shows this one stands out. Firefly chronicles the stories of the crew of the Firefly class transport 'Serenity'. The charaters are interesting and easy to relate to the story line is always deeply interesting. The show is charming, whitty and very intriguing. There is something in this show for anyone and everyone. I would highly recommend this show.</comment>

    <title>No pink hippos or lighthouses here, son...</title>
    <comment>I love a game of Golf, but seeing as how I'll never afford a set of Nike clubs - let alone the greens fees for a course like Pebble Beach, I have to settle for a game of synthetic Golf. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2008, from the sports division of Electronic Arts, is such a simulation. In it you go up against simulations of 23 of the finest PGA golfers today - including Tiger Woods. Show up at the first tee and you've practically won the round since none of the 23 play anything like their real life counterparts (if I were Tiger Woods, I'd sue EA Sports for reputation maligning). The 14 real world golf courses - including the "Dubsdread" course at Chicago's Cog Hill, have nothing to complain about, as they are beautifully recreated; it's as much a thrill to look off across distant hills as it is to watch your ball sail down the middle of a grassy fairway. The game is best enjoyed by any number of real golf enthusiasts, either within a LAN environment or in online/Net play. The game's two simulated tournament schedules - one from the PGA Tour and another from the FedEx Cup Challenge, are strictly for seekers of bragging rights; finishing either of these Leader Board based schedules, where it's you against a number of never-seen opponents (you only see their hard-to-believe results) requires stamina, patience and a little offline Profile management. Forget trying to spawn an amateur into a PGA Superstar (through the game's tutorials and sub-games). Design a Pro golfing avatar and enjoy a round of golf with three real friends. Bottom Line: There's nothing like a good game of golf - and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2008 is nothing like a good game of golf.</comment>

    <comment>This is great at college, no one will be able to steal your laptop with the lock once it is attached to your desk. It can be used anywhere but remember to try it out before you put it on your computer. Otherwise it will be stuck and wont be able to get it off.</comment>

    <comment>This is the one. We did a lot of comparison shopping (which I tell you is not as exciting as it sounds) and frankly, we used a lot of Best Buy reviews to help form an opinion. We selected and bought this Hoover model and were really pleased when we used it on our carpets. It's was very easy to assemble and though it takes some work to get out tougher stains, they do come out. As one other reviewer noted, you can use the strokes as wet, extra surge wet or dry and this helps to get the carpet to dry very quickly. I would highly recommend this model for your carpet and upholstery steam cleaning needs.</comment>

    <title>Awesome sound!</title>
    <comment>We've had our Bose system for a few months and have put it through the spectrum of audio. Whether listening to classical music that goes from soft flute to blasting cannons, or enjoying the pounding rhythm of dance-workout genre, the Companion 5s have consistently provided excellent sound. While viewing videos voices are clear and understandable. The lows from the base unit are solid and unmuffled, while the desktop speakers provide clear &amp; distinct mid and high tones. The styling is clean and attractive. Setup was a breeze. For the price, they're a great value: awesome sound from a solid and reputable company.</comment>

    <comment>The pedestals are really nice, as they provide additional storage space which is great. It also helps on the back for the appliances to be lifted higher. The only drawback is they are still a little to pricy. I still would recommend the pedestals for both the washer and dryer to make laundry less "back-tiring!"</comment>

    <comment>This is a great choice for Switchfoot fans. It has their early, more religious songs than their current work. Their sound is strong and real. I was really moved by many of the songs. The lyrics are great. They don't make CD's like these three anymore!</comment>

    <comment>This is the complete set of Starcraft games. Starcraft is one of if not the best strategic video game ever made, a true classic. While at this point the graphics will be slightly lacking, the gameplay more than makes up for it. This comes with the original game the expansion pack and guides to help you enjoy them to their fullest. Grab it quick to prepare yourself for Starcraft II coming out sometime in the next two years (&gt;.&lt; Blizzard) ~Shiva</comment>

    <title>A great ending... or is it begininning?</title>
    <comment>Its an old saying but it does hold true. George Lucas certainly saved the best for the last installment in the prequel trilogy. While this new trilogy got off to a shaky start, it definitely gained momentum and exploded on to the screen with Revenge of the Sith. There was so much energy in this film, so much emotion, and so much intensity, most people will say the entire prequel trilogy was well worth watching to see it play out. This movie was absolutely fantastic. Every Star Wars wanted this movie, and they got it. But knowing how it would turn out, didn't change a viewer wanting to see Anakin prevail and over throw the Sith influence. A good movie such as this, draws the audience in and makes us sympathize with the characters. We all wish for the best but know that it will all go horribly wrong. Yet, when all is done, we all still have Hope.</comment>

    <title>Grest Wireless Router</title>
    <comment>I read a bunch of different reviews on other sites. And the only problem that they reported was the unit was over heating. I was already using a D-link 4300 gamming router and loved it. I though if I have heat problems I could just cut a few holes in the case for better ventilation. I went down and picked one up, and to my surprise the unit is covered in plastic to protect the finish. I removed the plastic and installed the unit, after one month the unit still works great. I'm guessing that others for some reason never removed the plastic, and that caused the unit to over heat. Also make sure that you follow the instructions regarding adjusting the antenna correctly, it makes a difference. I highly recommend this unit; great features and performance, just don't forget to remove the plastic.</comment>

The actors are very outstanding in their role on the movie. I loved it. And like it said on the front cover is "hilarious". In other words is fair enough to buy the movie and share with the family on you free time.</comment>

    <title>Finally</title>
    <comment>Finally, a 1 disc collection that includes 3 bonus/unreleased tracks - and - the song "I Wanna Be Like You" from the soundtrack of Disney's "The Jungle Book" (with Phil Harris). There have been several "best of" collections for Prima, but this is the first that I've seen with the Disney track included. This one is definitely a greatest hits package!</comment>

    <title>Serenity / Firefly Lives!</title>
    <comment>The video of the Firefly tv series is superbly done, as is the movie follow-up of the series. The movie has a darker side to it than the series did, and there isn't the feeling of family that there was in the series, but I still thoroughly enjoyed them....I just wish there was much more to watch!</comment>

    <title>Good for stereo not for HT</title>
    <comment>The Bose 301 is a really good pair of speakers for a stereo setup, because they fill the whole room with reflected sound and pretty full highs and lows. In the same token, it is not good for a HT setup it will not pin point the source of the sound like a 5.1 system will do in movies. Also because of the reflection technology it lacks sound staging and imaging even in the stereo setup. So depending on what you like and need, the Bose 301 can serve the purpose correctly or badly. I listen mostly classical and jazz and I'm not interested in the debate of Bose vs. others. It is just my opinion and experience.</comment>

    <title>THE greatest game ever created.....period.</title>
    <comment>This could possibly be the best game to be designed since the dawn of the new millenium. I have personally played Halo 1 and it's sequel Halo 2, each one earning my ranking as BEST GAME EVER! I was lucky enough to get a sneak preview and play the demo in Japan in late July, and i can't explain enough about the brilliant and amazing things that we can all expect from this third installment of the HALO series. I would bet my beautiful brand new mustang that anyone who buys this game will instantly fall in love with it and play it all the way through numerous times without ever being satisfied. The game is nothing short of addicting in the best possible way. It's ultimate action and edge of your seat excitment in a box, and worth every penny.You WILL love this game, i guarantee it!</comment>

    <title>Great Quality, Solid Construction</title>
    <comment>Since I have my own speakers, I wanted a wireless system that didn't come prebuilt with speakers. The Rocketfish is the second wireless type system I have purchased. With the first wireless system (not the Rocketfish) I spent about 4 hours just trying to get some sound beyond 5 feet. It was of such poor quality that I returned it the next day. I was wary about buying another wireless speaker system, but the features of the Rocketfish were great, so I decided to try it out from Best Buy. I was extremely pleased by the quality construction of the Rocket Fish. It was very easy to setup (just plug in input and output speaker wires) and it had great sound 3 rooms away from the sender unit. The receiver unit (the larger part) even has a volume control knob. By the way, the speaker input is left and right channel, so you can use the Rocketfish to broadcast any channel instead of just surround sound.</comment>

    <title>Great Family Movie</title>
    <comment>I have seen this movie multiple times and would definately have to say that it is a very cute movie for both children and adults. Disney has done a wonderful job at making a very creative movie where you can go into the life of a bugs and "see what they'd see." I have shown this movie to many children and would definately love to show it off some more. I'd recommend this to people of all age groups, but especially younger children. Disney Pixar has once again put a quality and family oriented film on the shelves for all to enjoy.</comment>

    <comment>UCB is a very clever and funny show. I still find it funny after watching it several times. The show uses humor that you have not seen anywhere else and is impossible to not stop watching it. The cast on the show are some of the funniest people whoever lived. You will not regret purchasing this dvd if you are a person who loves comedies.</comment>

    <title>Elegant Film</title>
    <comment>This film is full of beautiful cinematography and splendid acting. It stays true to the majority of the plot and though they has to cut out a large portion of the novel, the meaning still rings through. Important features: Mr. Colins perfect, slimy, and full of Freudian slips. Watch for a three minute single shot scene during the dance at Neverfield and a perfectly times sunrise at the end of the film.</comment>

    <title>The Godfather meets the small screen</title>
    <comment>If you love the Godfather Saga or a huge fan of mob movies you will love all six seasons of the Sopranos. This season is the long awaited finale to this mob drama. It is filled with many twits and speculations and of course the biggest question, What happened to Toni?</comment>

    <title>Recommend for College Students</title>
    <comment>I was tired of dragging around CD's and/or "floppy" disks, and decided it was time to look for a memory card like I have seen my professors use. So, I went to Best Buy in Thousand Oaks (California) and looked around. There were several companies, and several various amounts of memory in these little "disks on strings" asking a few of the employees, they suggested a company called PNY. Well, to make a long story short, I bought the "top of the line" at the time of 4GB. I have yet to fill it. For the rest of hte year it carried my reports, some mp3's and picutures. Though I'm out of school - for now - I still use it and drag it around to friends houses and other places. One of the best purchases I have made dealing with something other than Music Cd's and movies.</comment>

    <title>South Park Season 10 Worth the Wait!</title>
    <comment>Who could forget some of the most memorable episodes of South Park ever? Such as the Hardly Boys featured in the Mystery of the Urinal Duece, or Oprah Winfrey's minge attempting to escape from lack of attention. I would recommend this season as well as any other season to any South Park fan. 5 Stars.</comment>

    <title>Very good moive!!!</title>
    <comment>If you like mystery, subpense and the thrill of characters leading you in one direction when it leads you into another then this a movie for you to buy. Anthony Hopkins keeps you on your toes by turning himself into a cold harded killer. Ryan Goslin who plays oppostie of him as an attorney trying to put this easy case of where a man kills his own wife for cheating on him. Easy yes but is it really that is easy though? The movie keeps you on your toes in ways it did for me. If you thought you would be able to figure it out with the first few minutes of the movie then try but I do recomend this beware of what you will see. Nothing is what it seems......</comment>

    <title>Works great with my Kenwood Reciever's USB Input!</title>
    <comment>I bought this thumb drive 6mo ago (it is slightly different appearance but same specs) to use with my Kenwood Excelon receiver's front USB slot. I have been waiting a decade for the end of CD format (as the idea was great but the discs themselves were horrible!) I bought this drive after having another 4GB thumbdrive from another company and I am much happier with the PNY drive now! It features a nice, low-profile design that matches my receiver perfectly. The data transfer rate is fast enough that I can play hours of music and never have a skip, stutter, or fault. I have noticed that I get an occasional blip in the music, but it is RARE and never very noticeable. I live in southern Mississippi and it gets extremely hot here in the summer. I have had this drive inside my car since the day I bought it and it has not changed the quality one bit. Overall I am very satisfied with this thumb drive and plan on buying a couple more for the rest of my music collection!</comment>

    <title>Great Movie, a must buy</title>
    <comment>I expected this movie to be somewhat like one of those National Lampoon movie by looking at the cover but I was glad it wasn't. This is a very good movie and does not have a single dull part in it. I would say this movie is funny in a dramatical way(if that makes any sense). This is my favorite movie of the year.</comment>

    <title>Stargate Atlantis: Not A SG-1 Clone</title>
    <comment>I am an avid Stargate SG-1 fan, and was worried that the spin off Stargate Atlantis would be much too similar to the SG-1. My fears were quickly lost as I began to watch the series on these DVDs. Atlantis successfully branches out and becomes its own show quickly into the season. The new angle brings much more mythology and explanation into the Stargate universe that is a breathe of fresh air. Atlantis introduces a deadly new enemy in the Wraith that makes the Gou'ald pale in comparison. Each episode has its special moments, mostly coming from that of Rodney McKay the egotistical super genius. This series begins strongly in its first season, and requires little knowledge of the SG-1 franchise to begin viewing. The series is now soon to begin its fourth season, so catch up and view the incredible first season.</comment>

    <title>favorite cartoon</title>
    <comment>I used to watch this show on MTV when i was a kid. I actually sat through a lot of questionable programming in hopes that AEon Flux would rear her crazy head. When this boxed set came out I freaked and bought it as soon as possible. I was not dissappointed. I still pop in a disc almost once a week for a fix of the Flux. There are three discs that together contain all of the pilot episodes where AEon dies, and all the longer episodes in their original order. the menus are easy to navigate and the picture and sound quality are perfect. Even the packaging is pretty. I didn't award the full five stars because I like when all the available information is on one disc. This set is separated into three discs, and it's a little bit annoying. Over all, however, this was a great buy.</comment>

    <title>The Best!!</title>
    <comment>Don't listen to the person that said its only single player. First off, this game has been tested by my buddy, and he has told me that WE can look forward to quad player campaign. Not to mention the fact that you can record short clips or entire games, and replay it as many times as you want; With all of the people in your party... Can you say, lets watch me own you again, and again, and again.... Does anybody else think that this is BAD***!!!! Also, Bungie themselves has said that this game is supposed to support up to 50 palyers in a single game.... HMMMM, anybody for a serious royal rumble?!? I will be pickin' this game up the day of release and the die hard that I am, will have it beat that night. This is my gamertag, so if you think you can handle it, look me up and lets play!!!</comment>

    <title>Super Mario 64 DS &gt; Super Mario N64</title>
    <comment>If you liked this game on the Nintendo 64, chances are you're going to like this one even more. It has everything the original had plus tons of extras. Where the original Mario had 120 stars, this game has 150 stars, new playable characters, and dozens of mini-games. Some of the ways by which to obtain the original stars have been edited to create a fresh new way to play while still feeling as fun as the original. As mentioned in the synopsis, you can play as three extra characters (Luigi, Wario, and Yoshi), each with their own special abilities to solve puzzles in the various levels that Mario can't solve on his own. You can play a battle mini-game with up to three friends via wireless connection in a quick race to collect stars or just fool around, and there's dozens of collectible mini-games which are fun enough to play on their own without the main game. I was a little worried that the touchpad would be awkward as a means of controlling your characters in a 3D world, but after several minutes, I had it mastered and it's really very easy. I've owned this game for several months now, and I still enjoy it thoroughly.</comment>

    <comment>I waited a very long time for this show to appear on DVD. When it finally came out I was not disappointed. The menu is easy to walk through, the picture and sound are great, and the selection of shows are extrememly funny. It is a clean show which makes it great for kids to watch and is funny enough to keep adults watching it too.</comment>

    <title>quality again!</title>
    <comment>This was supposed to be one of the most anticipated albums of 2007, and I was definitely one of those anxiously awaiting its release. I even pre-ordered two copies. It does not disappoint. All but one or two of the songs are wonderfully mastered and in classic Mae style, but they all have their own sound as well. Really, buy it. Don't even think about it.</comment>

    <title>Better than the Matrix</title>
    <comment>I heard people say before I watched this movie that it was comparable to the Matrix trilogy. I would actually disagree and say that this movie is *better* than the Matrix movies. Not only does this movie star some wonderful actors, but the plot also alludes to outstanding books such as 1984 by George Orwell. This movie gives the audience an action-packed, emotional, and mentally stimulating environment. Right from the start, you get involved with the plot--the painting The Mona Lisa is purposefully destroyed before your eyes while human beings stand aside and watch. And that's just the beginning. Christian Bale and Taye Diggs give stellar performances, and for those Batman fans out there, I would say Mr. Bale betters that movie by leaps and bounds. If you're not into action, you may not find this movie your cup of tea. After all, with a rating of R, there is some violence (duh!). Definitely more stimulating than so many movies out there, I would recommend this to ANY guy friend you have. I actually bought this for my Dad for his birthday, although I was secretly excited to have it handy for my perusal whenever I pleased. Check this one out and see for yourself!</comment>

    <comment>This movie has all the elements of surprise. I first rented this movie , then had to own it. This movie is not for the faint of mind, nor children. An animal symbolizes evil in a home that finds itself with topics if suicide, incest, homosexuality, and more. Reading subtitles will be worth it.</comment>

    <title>Not completly satisfying</title>
    <comment>While the film was an interesting concept and very intriguing until the end, I felt there was a major flaw that left me unsatisfied. Unfortunately, I cannot say exactly what that flaw is without giving the end away. I wouldn't say that this hole in the plot ruins the excitement of the movie. I believe it will be more enjoyable to watch knowing you will need to suspend your disbelief just a little. The performances were good, but nothing standout. You won't see any Oscar nominations from this film. The photography, on the other hand, was compelling.</comment>

    <title>Silliness reaches new heights</title>
    <comment>If you are a fan of the Mr. Bean television show, then you probably won't be disappointed in the movie. Basically, the physical comedy that made Mr. Bean a TV hit is just extended into a feature film that often reuses much of the same schtick from the TV show. Some of these repeat gags include the turkey on the head, falling asleep in public, and generally driving everyone around him crazy. There are some new and funny moments, but they don't stand up to repeated viewings of the movie. The supporting cast does a nice job and there's a good cameo by Burt Reynolds near the end. Overall, a decent film, but not too thought-provoking. A good choice if you are in the mood for silly humour and moderate chuckling.</comment>

    <title>Worth Buying</title>
    <comment>This was one of the smartest movies i've ever seen. The whole idea of the movie is a lobbyist for "big tobacco" fighting for smoking. This isnt what you might think, its not an anti-smoking or a pro-smoking movie, its a movie about a guy, Nick Naylor, and what he actually does for the company. This movie is funny, smart, and very entertaining, and has a pretty good message in it. One more thing to notice when you watch this movie, nobody smokes one cigarette in the whole movie. I also like how the movie case looks like a pack of smokes.</comment>

    <title>Microsoft LifeChat Stereo Headset</title>
    <comment>This is a very nice headset for the money. I love the inline volume and muting controls and use it all the time. The headset is very comfortable and lightweight. The foam ears completely cover the ears and help to hear what is playing better. The only issue I have had is the speaker need to be a little louder. Some of my programs can be a little quiet and makes it a little hard to hear even on full volume. But that is only an issue with one or two programs. I just guess I would expect it to be to loud to handle on max volume. But overall it is a great product.</comment>

    <title>A must own for every man's DVD collection</title>
    <comment>A couple of Irishmen, lots of beer, guns, shooting, and tons of action, what else do you need? The dialog is very entertaining and the war between the Irish saints and the Italian Mafia continues. Willem Dafoe is brilliant in this movie and has a couple catchphrase moments in the movie. This is one of my all-time favorite movies, if you've seen it then you need to buy it so you always have it on hand, if you havent seen it, then you need to.</comment>

    <title>Solid performance well worth the money.</title>
    <comment>I'm always a little leery about bass response from small speakers, but these Bose speakers punch out a satisfying amount of bass. I also especially enjoy the second audio input and am using these speakers to route my mp3 player through. I was worried about the lack of separate 'bass' and 'treble' controls, but the sound is equalized so well that it's a non-issue. Especially since my mp3 has an equalizer setting. Like other reviewers, I don't think you can go wrong with Bose. Their sound and quality consistently shine.</comment>

    <title>AMAZING SHOW!!!</title>
    <comment>I never got into this show when it first come out on tv back in 2005, i love David Boreanaz back when he was on Angel and Buffy, but I couldn't see him in this role. I initially purchased this dvd set for a friend who was in love with show. I started watching season 2 and i got hooked, i had to buy season one for myself. Yes everytime i watched it i wanted david to go all grrr... like on angel but i feel in love with the chemistry between him and Emily Deschnal. Great show, can watch it all the time, i recommend it to anyone who loves the CSI's and Without a Trace Shows. U don't know what u are missing!!!</comment>

    <title>Another Return Item</title>
    <comment>After opening and reading instuctions it was time to clean the disk. 6 slightly used AA batteries would not work. Had to have brand new batteries. Long story short it needs lots of juice. I didn't know it did not have a ac adapter included, that's a option. Of course the story I went to didn't have the adapter anyway so I don't know how much extra that would be. It's fine sandpaper mounted on a wheel that scratches the disk in a new even spiral pattern. Sounds like it wants to die on the new batteries you just put in. I took it back! Bought a Maxell Pro Disc Fixer DSR-1 (not from BB) Works well and seems to be a pretty good machine thous far. AC adapter included for same price. Makes the disk like new. Not spiral scratched.</comment>

    <title>Great Bag</title>
    <comment>I haven't had this bag for long so I can't attest to its wear and tear. But as far as space for multiple things, it is great. I have 17 inch laptop that fits great in it. It also has plenty of space for books, glasses, umbrella and any other odds and ends you can think of to put in it. I also like the space for my Ipod and the ability to listen to it with the earplugs coming out of the bag. The holder for a cell phone is nice because it detaches from the bag but I probably will not use it since I already have a holder. The bag can be heavy when it is full but the straps are wide and comfortable when carried as a backpack. One other thing that sold me was the lifetime warranty. I would definitely buy this again.</comment>

    <title>Bed time horror</title>
    <comment>The Grudge 2 was so thrilling to watch. I must say that it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. When I first watched it, I was alone at night. It was the greatest experience ever. Then I got to watch it with my friends and it was so fun to watch their expressions throughout this movie. I would highly recommend this movie for those who love horror movies.</comment>

    <title>Outstanding Monster Movie (and More)</title>
    <comment>This movie has been defined "Little Miss Sunshine" meets "Godzilla," and it is the best way to describe it: "The Host" is a great, scary, humorous, sweet-and-sour misadventure of a dysfunctional family who go on a quest to find a huge monster that has snatched the little daughter of the protagonist, whom everyone believes is still alive. But there's so much more to it, that you really have to watch the movie to appreciate all of the nuances of this Korean masterpiece. I recommend to watch it with the Korean audio track -- it adds much more to its charm. A real gem, who will surprise everyone who will watch it.</comment>

    <title>When's the next season</title>
    <comment>I remember this show from when I was a kid and when it was in reruns. This show was one of the funniest shows ever made. The cast was great, the comedy was fantastic; it seemed like there was nothing the cast wouldn't do for the laugh. The extras were pretty good as well hearing the cast talk about their experiences on the show and listening to the producers talk about putting the show together. The DVD itself was well done, the transfer appears to be perfect. I have been waiting for this show to be released on DVD forever and can't wait for the rest of the seasons. I couldn't more highly recommend this DVD if I tried.</comment>

    <title>MAJOR indoor dripping problem</title>
    <comment>As w/all new Frigidaire A/C's: Energy Star + C.R. ratings are tops. As others have noted for various BTU units: looks great, cools quickly (though louder than expected) so it should get 5-stars... BUT 3 months after summer '06 installation, it started leaking INSIDE my apartment &amp; summer '07 it started leaking right away, staining the wool wall-to-wall beneath, before I had time toput a 24" plastic planter trough below. It collects approx 2 gallons a day inside + what drips outside. Design-wise the external 'drip hole' is near the sill side / not the outside end &amp; only the diameter of a dime. There is no way to slide the 'guts' out &amp; clean the bottom of the A/C's casing of sludge, which I expect is blocking the flow. When I contacted Frig. (their Customer Service is excellent) the rep said she'd never heard of this prob which is why I'm posting this complaint - wondering if mine is a unique situation. They offered me a new unit, except mine was just past 1 yr old; so they're sending me a $60 credit toward a new one. [No probs w/a 6000 BTU unit I purchased at same time. This 12000 BTU is correct for size of space &amp; installed better than manual suggests - 1/2"downward slant, out of direct sunlight under covered balcony w/great airflow]</comment>

    <title>A fantasyland amid absurdities of war!!</title>
    <comment>Pans Labrynth "El Laberinto del Fauno" is a political statement on the absurdities of war, and demonstrates the possibilities of innocent fantasies even during these tumultuous times. Or maybe it's other way round. It's a fantasy tale showcasing the beauty of innocence over mature prudence (as we know it). Never the less, a treat to watch!! Director "Guillermo del Toro" hits a homerun in allowing viewers to see the post-civil war spain through the eyes of Ofelia, a young girl who reads fairy tales, lives under the terror of her stepfather, and is trying to complete three tasks (before full moon ) given by a "faun" so she could prove her essence is intact. Thereby, reunite in spirit with the king and queen of underworld as princess "Moanna". Whether story is a kid's fantasy or something more, is left open to viewer's interpretation in a way that could only be done by del Toro. Hats off to a masterpiece!!</comment>

    <title>Good upgrade</title>
    <comment>If you think you've seen Commando before on DVD then you're gonna pass on this one, right? WRONG! This guilty pleasure is one of my all-time favorite testosterone pumping 80's Ahnuld action flicks chock full of some of the most memorable and hilariously over-the-top one-liners ever assembled in a single Schwarzenneger film with an exhaustive body count tally of 81 confirmed kills. Now it's finally getting the UNRATED Director's Cut treatment it deserves so we can see even more of the Governator at his macho 80's Republican finest. The Commando Director's Cut DVD features the original 90-minute theatrical film plus an all-new 95-minute unrated version as envisioned by director Mark L. Lester restoring over five minutes of never-before-seen footage back into the film. Additional DVD special features include director audio commentary, deleted scenes, two behind-the-scenes featurettes, photo galleries and more. Special Features: Commando Director's Cut is presented in widescreen (1.85:1 aspect ratio) with English 5.1 Dolby Digital and Dolby Surround audio, Spanish Mono, French Stereo plus French and Spanish subtitles. Bonus content includes: * Seamlessly branched Director's Cut with never-before-seen footage * Audio commentary by director Mark Lester (on theatrical version only) * Deleted Scenes * Pure Action featurette * Let Off Some Steam featurette * Photo galleries with over 150 images - Creating Commando - Domestic Bliss with John and Jenny - Kill Arnold, Kill! - Trashing the Galleria</comment>

    <title>A Superb Collection - Dark Shadows Lives On!</title>
    <comment>This soundtrack collection has nearly every musical cue used on the classic cult television series of the 1960s, "Dark Shadows". Each track brings back so many memories. Because this is an "archive collection", the cues are all separate and in separate tracks. Some cues are as short as 6 seconds, while others go on for over 4 minutes. All the original variations of the eerie theme song, as well as "Josette's Music Box", "Quentin's Theme" ("Shadows of the Night"), and "Ode to Angelique", are included in this collection. As well as having all the "hit songs" from the show, this collection features all the little musical cues that made Dark Shadows so thematic, so wonderful. The Complete Music Collection has all of Bob Cobert's original music, but it doesn't have some of the songs that played on the Blue Whale Juke Box, like "Yesterday" (in the early episodes), or the first-used and quite inferior Music Box Theme for Josette (composed by a Canadian Composer and in the ABC Archives) (The Cobert version of Josette's Music Box [the one included in this collection] is the one we all know and love.), but it has pretty much everything else. This collection is so grand, and the icing on the cake is an interview with the composer himself, Bob Cobert. Now we just need to have the complete soundtrack to the 1991 Revival Series of "Dark Shadows", because Cobert's arrangements and songs in that series were beyond superb.</comment>

    <comment>This lens adds a lot of versatility to my camera. I mainly use it for action shots at my kids' sporting events including football, basketball and baseball. Unless I am really moving the camera myself, I can great great action shots with no blurring....even fully zoomed...with no tripod. Very easy to use. I love it!</comment>

    <title>Excellent Album</title>
    <comment>Every single song on this album is superb. I have the original version, without The Way it Goes and the acoustic version of Bats in the Belfry. The General, Dispatch's most famous song, is included on this CD. This alone would be reason enough to buy it, but there are several other good tracks. Bats in the Belfry, Here We Go, Bang Bang, Mission, Two Coins, and Outloud are all awesome. If you like this album, you'll probably also like Silent Steeples and Who Are We Living For? by Dispatch.</comment>

    <comment>Perhaps the best movie I've seen all year! Great storytelling, combined with British wit and American style oneupmanship makes for a hilarious and smashing comedy/action flick. While I'm not always one to bother with the special features, I couldn't wait to check out these, and I wasn't disappointed.</comment>

    <title>Amazing Product</title>
    <comment>I bought this few months ago, and im using it for my calculus class, it is hard to use(because it is very different from other graph calculator) but once u know how to use this, there is nothing better than this calculator for math class(higher than calculus)</comment>

    <title>Babylon 5 Hunger Satisfied</title>
    <comment>The Lost Tales DVD is new Babylon 5 DVD movie that has been long awaited. But brace yourself, this doesn't quite feel like a traditional B5 episode. It is two separate stories told on a much smaller, personal scale. There aren't many extras (as in actors) so the station feels a bit empty. But once I got past this, I enjoyed The Lost Tales very much. What was truly wonderful was the special features. In my opinion, the disk was worth it just for that. There is some very funny footage of JMS demonstrating his plan to film the movies with sock puppets. And there are wonderful interviews with each of the B5 principals. Plus behind the scenes stuff, and Q&amp;A with JMS. The Lost Tales is not B5 as we remember it, but the spirit is still the same, the stories are still engaging, and the graphics are better.</comment>

    <title>Farewell Buffy</title>
    <comment>Many were disappointed by the last season of Buffy, but not me. I believe if you take the time and watch the entire season, you will see many loose ends tied up, and many things we all wanted, quenched. Those who are pulled between the Spike/Buffy/Angel triangle, should be fairly satisfied with the plot twists. Some things are left to the imagination, but ultimately Sunnydale meets it's final demise. I highly recommend the seventh season!</comment>

    <title>Great Router - Easy Installation for Avg guy</title>
    <comment>The installation was great all the directions were straight forward and it got me up and working. Have not tried the wireless portion yet, but Linksys and Cisco are top of the line. If the wireless works as good as the router/switch, I would give 5 stars</comment>

    <title>Mediocre Film Version. Buy Olivier Or Branagh's.</title>
    <comment>Franco Zefferelli ("William Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet," "Jesus Of Nazareth") directs what seems to be the 200th film version of William Shakespeare's classic tragedy. Misplaced way too many lines, the examples of which wouldn't fit here. Buy Kenneth Branagh or Laurence Olivier's film versions instead. They're much better.</comment>

    <title>The story of a boy and a machine</title>
    <comment>The continuation of the story of John Connor and the resistance, this action packed thriller starts off with T101 (Arnold) rescuing John Connor from the T1000. Later, they decide to rescue John's mother, only to be confronted by the T1000. I recommend new viewers to see the first Terminator, but this is a great one too.</comment>

    <comment>Ultimate Avengers II picks up where the first left off, the aliens are still trying to take over the earth, and our brave troup must try and stop them. A new addition to the lineup is the Black Panther, a nice addition I might add, and some secrets of the first movie are revealed. The animation is nice, the plot done well, and I would recommend it to any superhero fan.</comment>

    <title>The Perfect Stove</title>
    <comment>My new KitchenAid Gas Range (Architect Series II) is my first brand-new stove, and it has everything: looks like a professional chef's range and produces a flame that's adjustable from very high heat to very low. There's also a reversible grate to support my wok. Besides that, my new stove has a convection oven that makes everything I cook taste tender, juicy and better than my old ordinary oven. Because it blows the heat around the food, it uses lower temperatures and less time than nonconvection ovens. I can also delay the start of cooking, so my food is ready when I get home from work. Below the oven is a warming drawer that works for heating plates, holding hot bread and side dishes, and keeping dinner warm during unexpected delays. Last, but not least, the oven cleans itself! What a blessing for getting rid of those baked-on spatters and fruit pie spills. Thanks, Kitchen-Aid, for answering my fondest dream! --The Lazy Cookie</comment>

    <title>A great help</title>
    <comment>I am so glad I got the pedestals for both my washer and dryer. The drawers slide easily in and out, fit most laundry items (although a few large detergent bottles are too tall), and make it so much easier to access the washer and dryer without bending. I have a small closet laundry and the pedestals are a great space saver! I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for more storage space and better access in their laundry room.</comment>

    <comment>This is a very funny movie. I would rate it pretty high among other parodies, but the screwball comedy isn't for everyone. If you're a Mel Brooks fan, you will appreciate this movie (although you'd probably had seen it). If you're not a Mel Brooks fan, this is a good place to start.</comment>

    <comment>This is one of the very few (if not only) romantic movies that keeps me coming back to watch it again and again. I'm a 40 year old male and I still cry every time I watch this movie. It makes the ultimate statement about the power of love. I rented it and went out and bought it the next day. It's that good!!!</comment>

    <comment>this is a great compact flash cards for any SLR cameras out there that supports Compact Flash Type 1. The only reason I rated it a 4 is because I have heard many rumors that it had failed on them after awhile in use but I've been using it for 2 months now and I haven't had a problem yet with my new Canon 20D and 40D. It's just a great amount of storage and you don't have to have a spare. If you're going to take pictures with a SLR camera, get this!</comment>

    <title>Awesome Purchase</title>
    <comment>I highly recommend ALL the seasons of the Rockford Files. I bought seasons 1 - 4 from Best Buy, and I've enjoyed watching every one. I can't wait for seasons 5 - 7 to be released so that I can watch them also. James Garner is "One of my favorite actor's". He does a spectacular job portraying Jim Rockford, a Private Investigator who is an lovely man, always willing to help his fellow man. This show was made in the 70's, but it will forever be a show that I love. They don't make television shows like this anymore. The Rockford Files is TV at it's finest thanks to James Garner's awesome personality.</comment>

    <title>Wonderful CD</title>
    <comment>I have heard of this band several times over the years but never listened to them. I finally did and am so impressed with them. This CD in particular is my favorite, all the songs are incredible and have a great vibe. Jenny Lewis has a really unique beautiful voice and they have a sound all their own. I highly recommend this CD.</comment>

    <title>Confusing</title>
    <comment>There are several male actors that I love to watch because of their looks and/or their acting, and I will usually buy any movie that they are in. Mark Wahlberg is one of these actors for me, so I was excited when Shooter was available on DVD. Fortunately, I decided to rent it first before buying it. I liked the actors, the plot, and the action, but Mark Wahlberg spoke so softly and often slurred or mumbled his words that I had trouble understanding what he was saying. And a lot of the dialogue was in military jargon - codes, numbers, abbreviations - and I had no idea what they were talking about. I started the movie over a few times and turned up my volume to see if it helped which it didn't. Then I finally changed the setup to include subtitles and watched the whole movie while I read them. That is the only way I could understand what the characters were saying which is annoying. Good actors and good action are not enough to make a 4 star movie, and Shooter proves it. I would watch it again but I won't buy it.</comment>

    <title>Totally Inspirational!</title>
    <comment>I really liked Mandisa on American Idol - she is a beautiful, talented lady - plus she is a Christian and not afraid to give praise and thanks to the Lord for who she is and where she goes. I listen to her CD when I work out and it truly inspires me - when I work out, it's a chance to relax and have some ME time - away from everything and everyone...her music and voice soothe me and take me to where I really need to be - with God and realizing that I shouldn't worry about what I look like, what I have - just be who you are, be happy with what you have and your life will just "be" - thanks!</comment>

    <comment>I have caught this on tv a couple of times and my husband is a big superman fan, and he had also seen it a couple of times on tv. So a week ago I decided to get the season, It just happened to be on sale when I was checking out some movies at Best Buy. So I picked it up, and like a book I could not shut it off. I think we have watched the complete season in a week. This was a really well laid out DVD and the extras were great. If you like superman and want a todays version this is a great watch. Check it Out...</comment>

    <title>Good 80's Retro</title>
    <comment>Being from the 80's I thought it was great. The video gave a history of the band via personal interviews, etc. There is even a retro 3D version of one of the songs and icludes the glasses. A must for any 80's collection.</comment>

    <title>Yeah, bring back the Saturday morning memories! A+</title>
    <comment>Any kid living in the mid sixties had to know about Space Ghost during Saturday mornings on CBS. ABC and NBC had there heroes too! Space Ghost, Superman, Spider-man, Birdman, Young Samson, and Fantastic Four were just some of the cartoons that were brand new or created from comic book heroes. Remember 1966 was the year that 'Batman' had come to television and hero mania was in high gear. I remember liking these new shows because they looked like real people instead talking animals. Space Ghost was one of the very best. The bad guys were bad and the good guys were heroic. Space Ghost the complete series on two DVDs is a great buy. The quality is very good and for the money it was one of the better animated series of the day. Incredible power bands, 'inviso-power', and the coolest space ship since Star Wars. Re-watching these in their original format really brings back some fun memories but surprisingly they also hold up well today. NOTE: this is NOT the Space Ghost from Cartoon Network's 'Space Ghost Coast to Coast' show. That was made for comedy and in truth it made me really miss this original Space Ghost series. I was delighted to find this DVD set on a visit to my local Best Buy store. The episodes are in their 'first appearance' and original order and they include the Dino Boy adventures between every two Space Ghost episodes. Dino Boy has gotten some bad press I think. They dealt with some pretty serious stuff on those shows like cults for example (and this really came home after seeing Mel Gibson's 'Apocalypto'). Not every body cared for Dino Boy but it really wasn't as bad as some of the reviews I have read. All in all you buy one DVD set and you get the complete series. That's it. No more episodes to buy. One of the best features is the final six part "Council of Doom' episodes. Space Ghost has to fight six of his greatest enemies who have banded together. It is all very serious and on a par with the sci-fi action of Star Wars or Transformers. Not only that but he also meets other Hanna Barbera heroes of the day. You get the original Space Ghost and the price is great too (about the cost of one movie today). This set should be suitable for adults and children alike. OH! By the way there is a great feature about the artist who designed Space Ghost Alex Toth. If you are into cartoons or comic books it is worth the price of the DVD alone. A first rate production. Hit the 'inviso-power' I'm done.</comment>

    <title>Worth the money.</title>
    <comment>I'll admit that this game's graphics aren't all that great most of the time, and there are more glitches than a game should have, but it is still a fun game to play. The combat and magic systems are very simple but also entertaining. I was also a bit dissapointed with the choppy framerate and the lackluster voice acting. All cons aside, this game has a decent amount of play value and it has the addicting quality that an RPG should have. Not the greatest game in the world, but definitely worth the purchase.</comment>

    <title>Estrogen Highs and Lows</title>
    <comment>Prior to purchasing the Girls High v.1 dvd, I had read 3 volumes of the manga. By comparison, the manga is a bit more fun but at times the manga series was pretty incoherent. The anime is pretty well put together but didn't take as many chances as the manga did. The anime and manga have almost completely different storylines. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you haven't read the manga, the anime stands pretty well on its own. The only unfortunate feature of the anime, to me, is the fact that it is subbed only. I about freaked out when I brought it home! I'll check the labels next time. It's awfully surprising that Best Buy would have a subbed-only anime. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I give this anime a 3 out of 5 stars and suggest if you are dubbed-only, don't purchase this anime.</comment>

    <title>Most Under Rated and Unknown College Movie</title>
    <comment>Broken Lizard's "Puddle Cruiser" is by far one of the most under rated college movies. Insted of like most college movies it speaks to you on an intellectual level with it's plot and script. It is definitely their second best movie only t the great "Super Troopers."</comment>

    <title>The Party</title>
    <comment>Simply hilarious from beginning to end! Love this movie - makes me laugh every time I watch it! I want to watch it every time I want to get in a better mood. I can't remember how many times I have seen it, but every time, it's like the first time. Peter Sellers is a comedic genious! His accent, his mannerisms will make you roar with laughter. I like to also share it with both children and adults. Nobody so far has disliked it. On the contrary they want to make it part of their DVD repertoire. I highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys clean comedy!</comment>

    <title>Outstanding Purchase</title>
    <comment>This was the most outstanding purchase I ever made for my laptop. It had enough compartments to carry my project binder, books, laptop and all my other accessories for my laptop. It is not like the other backpacks where the material start to wear after a few uses. This is a very durable product. I recommend this backpack if you need space, compartments and durability.</comment>

    <title>Great Product If You Have Wireless N</title>
    <comment>I bought this product and am actually connected to it right now as I type this. This is a great router and is very fast. The only downside to it is that I had to buy a wireless-n card, which is a pain. Right now I'm just using my built-in G card and it runs great, but a little expensive just to use it for that. Make sure your laptop has wireless n built in before you buy this router to get the full effects.</comment>

    <title>Decent Memory</title>
    <comment>The memory is stable and when I bought it was at a great price of $40 per 1 GB stick... apparently the price has gone up, I wouldn't recommend you pay the $99 currently asked for it, but at a decent price is a great deal. Stable, solid memory that prevents hiccups. I haven't had any issues.</comment>

    <title>The Beginning of a Legend...</title>
    <comment>I will try to skip going over a synopsis of this film, as I'm sure you can find one elsewhere. I will say that this film is utterly fantastic, brilliant, and well-written. It is now one of my all-time favorite films. I will now focus on the DVD. The first disc includes (of course) the film itself. The picture quality is amazing. Everything is very clear and sharp with nice, vibrant colors. It could not be better. The sound is a little harder to judge. I do not have a surround sound setup, and therefore cannot say what it sounds like coming through 6 speakers, etc. But even with the good old-fashioned 2-speaker stereo setup, the sound is clear and dynamic. A very good job all-around. Also on the first disc is the trailer for the film and the hilarious Batman Begins spoof, "Tankman Begins". The second disc includes the rest of the special features. Most of these are short documentaries, each focusing on a specific behind-the-scenes topic. Everything you will want to know is covered, from the forming of the film's story to casting the characters, from building the Batman suit to the creation of the spectacular visual effects. All of these features are accesible through a creative, "interactive comic-book" format. Also on the second disc are some 'character files'; short biographies for the fictional characters in the film. There are also a few hidden features for those who wish to hunt them out. All in all, this is an excellent DVD release of an excellent film, and worth every penny of the price.</comment>

    <title>Great Buy</title>
    <comment>This is a great value. The paper is the advanced photo paper. It is not the top of their line of paper but the quality is still really good even for framing photos. I specifically bought a printer that has the 02 individual ink. The ink alone in this package is half the price of the ink from my last printer plus you get 150 sheets of 4x6 photo paper.</comment>

    <title>Great headphones</title>
    <comment>The Bose on-ear headphones provide great sound and block out external noise. They are extremely comfortable. They aren't too big and come with a nice carrying case. I would definitely recommend these if you are looking for a nice set of headphones.</comment>

    <title>Ergonomic Keyboard</title>
    <comment>This keyboard is great as far as ergonomics and the hotkeys are also well placed and easy to use. The "back" and "forward" explorer buttons just below the space bar are a wonderful idea, and the stand that it sits on works extremely well for the keyboard drawer I have assembled under by desk. I purchased this keyboard in an effort to replace the wireless keyboard my young children keep ripping keys off of. I like this keyboard cause the keys are easy to put back on and I think a little harder to remove in the first place.</comment>

    <title>Good Movie</title>
    <comment>This is a good movie for any naruto fan. Those who follow the series will definitely see this as expanding on the spirit of the show. The story is definitely a feel good story with a good number of twists and turns. The animation is fluid and visually dynamic. Those who haven't seen naruto may be lost in some sections but it is still a fun action movie. Either way, it is definitely recommended.</comment>

    <title>Fun to Sing a long With</title>
    <comment>My daughter loved the movie so we bought the soundtrack for her to listen to in the car. She sings along with the songs.....her favorites are "Leson Number One" and "Like Other Girls". She never gets tired of listening to it. I even find myself singing along sometimes.</comment>

    <title>A New Classic</title>
    <comment>It is a beautifully made movie. It's based on the painting, Girl with a Pearl Earring, done by Dutch painter Vemeer. He was a very gifted artist, and the movie was based on his most famous work. Scarlett Johanssen really captured the character and gave her depth that went beyond what she said and does in the movie. When you see her in the movie, you truly believe she is the maid she plays. The movie visually is incredible. It shows the different sides of the city and the different things the different classes experienced, all without over-explanation or over-telling it. The dirtiness of the city that the lower classes experienced is shown but not stressed. In some scenes, you see Greete's hands are red and raw, showing exactly how hard she had to work, all while the 'master and mistress' sit around and watch, all without lifting a finger. The opposites cannot be better told than through the two women, Greete and the 'mistress' of the house (Vermeer's wife). While the mistress is sitting around, playing with her hair, barking orders, and treating Greete like she was a pebble in her shoe. Greete however, showed Vermeer she cared and that she was interested in his craft, something his wife never bothered to do. In one scene, Greete asks the mistress if she may clean the windows in the studio, and after the mistress gets exasperated and says condescendingly "You don't have to ask about such things," Greete says, "but, it may change the light". The mistress suddenly understands, and instead of comprehending what it might do to the light in the studio, she says in a spiteful way, "clean them." This one scene shows the beginning of the hatred between these two women. This is a fantastic movie for anyone who has any interest in art whatsoever. Also, anyone who enjoys a good story and visually expressive drama will really like this movie. A must-have for any movie collection to be complete.</comment>

    <title>A Roxy Diversion</title>
    <comment>As a longtime Roxy Music band fan thanks to my brother years ago, I watched this DVD w/ some reluctance. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed watching &amp; listening to it. The studio band is very good, includes guitarist Chris Spedding plus drummer Andy Newmark, &amp; Ferry interprets the Dylan songs quite well. I might have enjoyed more of Bryan speaking about the music, but there's just enough interview of him to pad out the surrounding songs. The dvd extras are slight, but nice additions also. I'm not sure it's a dvd that will get watched over &amp; over. Maybe buy the music cd for that...and look forward to the new Roxy Music release next year!</comment>

    <title>Wonderful gift for our daughter</title>
    <comment>My father wanted to buy our daughter a guitar. We looked around and found this Gibson. I was amazed at the idea of getting a Gibson for such a great price, let alone all that comes with it. She is ecstatic with her first guitar and the quality is great. It is beautiful to look at as well. I had not known that Best Buy even sold guitars until my dad told me. Wonderful surprise, great gift, and a good purchase.</comment>

    <comment>great music ,great performances by best people in the world after watching this event on this great edited DVD you really want to do something for africa and what is going on there, being a pink floyd fan what more could i expect than a reunion by the band for such a nobel cause, the queen of music madonna performance was perfect, specialy the short movie about the dying girl (who is an engineer right now ,thanks to bob geldof) before her performance was just moving. this DVD is a best buy in everyway ,great music,great performers,great cause, purchasing this DVD is just a small step we can all take to get rid of poverty.</comment>

    <title>touching and funny film</title>
    <comment>This low-budget comedy is a charming but sometimes squirm-inducing look at dysfunctional college romance. Clearly a lot of care went into getting the details, humor, and poignancy accurate to people looking for love in a collegiate setting. Unusually strong female characters hold their own with the main guys, both dramatically and comedically. As a date movie, it's entertaining and thought-provoking, but be sure you're secure in your relationship before watching it! I'd say it owes more to films like 'Swingers' and 'Chasing Amy' but it does have echoes of 'Annie Hall.'</comment>

    <title>backwards slide</title>
    <comment>But for the title track, this album would be a thoroughly disappointing effort for the garage rock duo - lyrically obvious, musically repetitive, and sonically overproduced. Where is the brash blues of "De Stijl" and the country warmth of "Get Behind Me Santa"? [Apparently the real title of their previous album is considered "profanity" by BestBuy.com.] Inspired spins on tried-and-true motifs made that which was old new again in the Stripes' past, but this showing feels too much like yesterday's news.</comment>

    <title>not just one</title>
    <comment>I so totally love these memory sticks! Up to 1500 images per stick. I can't believe the capacity of them! Not only are they great memory sticks, but buying them from Best Buy is so economical. The day I went in to purchase this product I had just returned from a vacation, and I was actually looking at replacing an old digital camera broken on my trip. The sales tech said my memory sticks were outdated. I told her which camera I was thinking about, she pointed out that three quarters of the digital cameras in my range used these, and they're also on sale. I listened to her advice and purchased two double cartridge packs. Saving lots of money. A couple days later I went back and purchased the camera and was quite pleased with not only the camera and memory sticks but with the sales girl who helped guide me. Thanks Best Buy</comment>

    <comment>The guys will love this film because of the constant action, the ladies will love it because the blood gore isn't over the top (not to mention all of those muscles), and film-lovers will love it for the cinematography &amp; story line.

    <comment>This is one of the most exciting and addictive TV series I have ever watched. The picture quality is excellent, the story line is intriguing, and the characters are well developed so that you actually like and care about them. I highly recommend Heroes to viewers of all genres. Deleted scenes are cool and the audio commentary is interesting as well, especially on disk one.</comment>

    <title>one of the best martial arts films ever</title>
    <comment>tony jaa is awesome in this movie. his stunts are amazing, and the film shows lots of the in different angles so you don't have to rewind the movie to see the stunt again. -- if you can watch subtitles while watching the movie i'd suggest that, but if you can't multitask you can dub it in english. -- very cool movie even if you've never watched a martial arts film!</comment>

    <title>Great performer at a great price.</title>
    <comment>I bought the gs105 to increase the bandwidth on my home network for streaming video files to my media center pc. | As with all of the netgear products, their construction is far superior to any other brand of consumer network hardware. The case is made out of metal, and is very solid, and is attractive to me because netgear puts fuction over form. | The setup couldn't have been simpler, from opening the box to running a test transfer to check for speed took less than a minute. Also, the AC adaptor is designed so it won't take up more than one plug on a power strip. | I decided to check how much it improved the network speed, so I did a file transfer test on my 100mbps switch before I installed the gigabit switch and here are the results: | File Size: 733,949,952 bytes ( ~716 mb) | netgear fr114p 10/100 mbps prosafe firewall/router: 8831.5 kb/s 83.1 Seconds | netgear gs105 gigabit ethernet switch: 32696.9 kb/s 22.4 Sec | At this point the speed bottleneck changes from the network media to the hard drive transfer rate, as one of the computers used in the test has PATA hard drives.</comment>

    <title>Not that great</title>
    <comment>I wouldn't recommend this phone unless you have the most up to date perfect phone lines in the world. I couldn't hardly hear anything over the static, but I live in one of the older areas where lines where last upgraded around 1952, maybe. Had to return it and go back to my old 900 hz Panasonic. Wish it had worked though.</comment>

    <title>Rising Star</title>
    <comment>I hadn't heard of Morrison before this CD but he won me over. He is a rising star, still young and developing, and has a unique voice and his song "Pieces Don't Fit Anymore" is a modern classic. If you like this type of music, bluesy singer-songwriter genre, then you should love this album. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Everything is Beautiful</title>
    <comment>First off, this is a band I love unreservedly and put on the best, most energetic concert I've ever seen...in my house. This is certainly a pretty single, a great, quaint example of what Jeff Mangum was doing as a solo effort before he assembled "the Band". Jeff was doing all kinds of sound collage before getting down to writing great songs, which I think is important for any songwriter, to have songs that don't necessarily say anything-- just sounds that express emotion. This is not to say that Jeff is not a fantastic song writer, his best lyric is every bit as great as the best Bob Dylan lyric. Try him out and decide for yourself. His stuff is marvelous to behold whether he is just playing by himself on an acoustic guitar or he is backed up by "the Players". It's no wonder he has influenced a whole new generation of musicians with his craft and style. If you an amazingly produced, written, emotional record, see "In the Aeroplane over the Sea". If you want an equally powerful, home recording style record, see "On Avery Island".</comment>

    <title>Feel like you have talent</title>
    <comment>Sure the mini guitar strapped around you with color coded buttons on the neck may seem cheezy, but quickly it becomes nonmaterial as you get engrossed on your mission of rhythmatically pounding and strumming your way to please the crowd. It is much more rewarding than it seems. Arguably, the better of they rhythm games out there (like ddr) because it actually feels guitarish instead of dancing in a wierd way you would (hopefully) never do in public. Just dont even think about it. And after the initial hurdle, you will most likely be challenging others while wearing a mullet wig and bandana in no time. That is unless, you still have mullet hairstyle. And if thats the case... you are too cool! The sound track is rewarding and noteworthy.</comment>

    <comment>I actually liked this game a lot...it was a bit easier than Guitar Hero 2...but that is why I liked it...I also loved the song selection. I loved all the old songs...the 80's music is definitely what makes this game fun. I would totally recommend this to a friend. It is a lot of fun.</comment>

    <title>Tennis fans fix</title>
    <comment>This is no sega sports tennis but its no outlaw tennis either. With the feel of hot shots with super deformed heads characters it feels like a nintendo game...much like a mario tennis game. The graffics are clean but unimpressive. And the play is good but the oversimplification may leave the hardcore tennis fans bored more quickly. The style of gameplay suggests that there should be a special move per character but dont. The replays are only of smashes which get old quickly. It is definately more challenging when you beat a slew of mediocrity. Dont expect frills of minigames.</comment>

    <comment>This album really shows you that they have matured not only that but their fans mistaked them for something that their not and they just want to prove to their fans exactly how they are, when they said Dont talk ; just listen thats exactly what they want their fans to do, just sit back and listen to what they have to sing/rap and you'll understand them for who they really are.")</comment>

    <title>Completely Worth It</title>
    <comment>Very rarely can I find a new CD where I enjoy the every track on it. Most of the time its just a select few on the disc that get listened to, but not this one. To say Timbaland has talent would be an understatement. Instead of focusing everything on him, he has a hidden way of brining new talent out. My original intent on buying this was to get a good version of the song Apologize feat OneRepublic another Timbaland find. Needless to say I fell in love with all 17 tracks and have probably burned a couple holes (not really) into the cd where tracks 14-17 are. Timbaland's unique ability to mix a beat into his songs is mind blowing and will have you turning the volume all the way up! Find out for yourself and grab the next copy you find!!!!</comment>

    <title>Heroes in a Half Shell</title>
    <comment>So, if you're not familiar with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (aka: TMNT), then I suggest checking out Wikipedia.org or just searching Google. There are plenty of fan sites built to this franchise. This DVD set actually comes from the original TMNT series which aired in 1987 and ran for about 9 years. During this time, the TMNT franchise was at its peak, as Playmate was scrambling to bring fans into the series which would later be used solely to sell a toy line. The premise of TMNT is a little more complex than most cartoons of its time. A man named Humato Yoshi was banished to New York after being suspected of plotting to kill a grand master. Oroku Saki (his nemesis) followed him to New York and tried to kill him with a radioactive mutagen. The mutagen cause Yoshi to transform into a rat, while Yoshi's pet turtles became humanoid. Yoshi trained the turtles in the martial arts, so they're now crime fighting heroes. They must now battle Oroku Saki (who now calls himself the Shredder) and his minions. Volume 2 starts with Return of the Shredder. In this episode, Shredder returns from Dimension X after being trapped there in the 5 part series pilot. Upon returning, he begins to strike against the Turtles and prepare for an invasion from Dimension X. The DVD ends with Return of the Technodrome, in which Shredder attempts to raise his battle station to the earth's surface. IF you've never seen the original 5 part pilot, TMNT Volume 2 is episodic enough to fill you in on what's what. Basically, a henchman appears and you just kinda know he's evil. That's the beauty of this series. Also, there are about 4 episodes that are part of an ongoing story line. Unlike the majority of the series (which is very episodic), the continuity helps the TMNT franchise feel less like a marketing ploy and more like a serious series. What surprised me in this DVD was the action. Unlike the rest of the TMNT series, there's actually violence. The Turtles hold nothing back in fighting. They strike against the forces of evil with all they have, unlike later in the series where parent groups has complained about the Turtles being too violent. After this happened, the fights were reduced to slapstick routines. Most notable was Michelangelo's decreased usage of his nunchaku. Another interesting note is that the animation in this volume is pretty good. In comparison to the rest of the series, the animation here is only a notch below the current series (which mirrors Japanese anime). The sad story is that as the series aged, it became much more syndicated and the push was on producing more without regard for quality. Here in Volume 2, the quality is still a major factor. What I really didn't care for in this DVD is that every episode sets up the classic formula. As the series progresses, you get a distinct feeling for how an episode will play out. First, there's an insidious plot by Shredder. Somehow the Turtles catch wind of it. They then must figure out what Shredder's up to. After an initial confrontation, Shredder escapes or beats the Turtles. The Turtles regroup for a final showdown. The Turtle emerge victorious. Though it was a different time back in the 1980's, I would've appreciated a different approach to the main plot. With such a formulaic flow, it makes the outcome of every episode static. At times, it seems as if they have to stick to the formula, so they quickly write something to make the "happy ending." It's a shame, since the current iteration of TMNT (started in 2002) has a much better plot line as the continuity from episode to episode leads into something bigger. All things considered, this is a show that kids may enjoy. With less violence than most television today, parents can show this to their kids without worry that they'll corrupt their children. I would recommend owning this DVD, though, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to find it unless you're a hard core TMNT fan. It definitely has some replay value and is worth the $10 investment.</comment>

    <title>Not her best</title>
    <comment>I'm a Rosie Thomas fan but I have to admit this is NOT her best work. I do love the "Kite Song" which was also featured in Paste Magazine. The remake of "Song Bird" is disappointing. "Say Hello" is cute but short and with an abrupt unfinished ending. If you want a Rosie cd, I recommend one of her others "When We Were Small" or "If Songs Could Be Held".</comment>

    <comment>This game will keep you entertained for months even after you beat the game (which is no easy task on realistic difficulty). Co-op mode with a friend is a great time and the single player story mode is very challenging and also entertaining. Great graphics, sound, and controls make this game an easy decision to buy!</comment>

    <comment>Absolutely loved this DVD set. I had purchased it for $100, which made iteven better. The extras are okay, but you can also find them on TBS.com. Season 6 is by far my favourite. I would have bought season 6 by itself to be honest, but I love going back and reminiscing on Carrie &amp; Aiden, Carrie &amp; Big, Charlotte and her tumultuous marriage, etc. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Hot Fuzz is a great movie!</title>
    <comment>I didn't expect to like Shaun of the Dead, but loved it. So the bar set for Hot Fuzz was pretty high. I have to say that Simon Pegg and Nick Frost did a great job with HF - it is well paced, has a decently kooky plotline, continuous laughs and (suprisingly) great action that keeps you watching. Pegg &amp; Frost did it again!</comment>

    <title>Great Emotional Movie</title>
    <comment>This is the best way to revisit this horrorable time in American history, because you already know whats gonna happen but the director shows a behind the scenes look at the FAA, New York Airport Tower, and Air Force as they try to find out what is happening. Director Paul Greengrass should have won an Oscar for vision, and overall Best Picture.</comment>

    <title>50 Cent still number 1!</title>
    <comment>50 Cent is still number 1! His c.d. is loaded with hits and he's still at his best. I think 50 put work into this album because he really worked with other artists (ex. Mary J. Blige, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland) and made good songs with them. Kanye really only has 1-2 good songs that's why I think 50 will top Kanye West on the charts.</comment>

    <title>So far so good!</title>
    <comment>We just bought this after seeing that this was the best rated steam cleaner on Amazon.com. The house that we purchased has snow white carpet thoughout. Who puts in snow white carpet? I didn't think they even made snow white carpet! Anyway, with a dog who loves to jump in the lake and a cat who throws up from time to time, we had to get something great. So far I'm thrilled. Since we moved in there has been a stain on the carpet that looked like a 2-foot line of oil that dripped. I tried the Resolve 2-in-1 carpet cleaner, which is a fantastic product, that didn't even take it out. So my husband fired up the SteamVac and out it went! It has also made 2 cat throw up spots disappear. As for the dog dirty paw prints, those came out with no problem.</comment>

    <title>Another solid album from Kanye</title>
    <comment>Kanye West has never failed to impress. That certainly doesn't change with the release of this album. After listening to both albums, I am sure that he will come out on top of the well publicized competition with rival 50 cent (whose newest release, curtis, was a bit disappointment in my opinion). This record plays well from start to finish focusing on Kanye's excellent production, beats, and choruses. His lyrics on this release are good even if slightly cheesy at times (drunk and hot girls, for one example). The first single, Stronger, which includes an incredible sample of Daft Punk is a strong point. Also standout tracks are The Champion, Big Brother, and The Glory. Kanye West has a way of appealing to all types of music listeners and he seems to have an appreciation for music in general. This is a must have album that is not limited to fans of hip-hop/rap.</comment>

    <title>The Best Banter of All Time</title>
    <comment>Banter. That's what makes this movie what it is; and it is amazing. Intelletigent, quick, and off the wall - Lucky Number Slevin has everything you ever wanted a mobster movie to have. Centered around a mysterious young man named Slevin, the plot follows his outlandish, sudden, and uncontrollable journey into the underground of a city run by two mob bosses. Every step he takes seems to bring him closer to his own impending doom, and the thrill don't stop until the very end, a remarkable trait when it comes to mob movies. However, what truly makes this movie incredible is how the story is told, not the story itself. There are tons of movies out there about mobsters, but how many mobster movies (serious mobster movies) can you say that you laughed most of the way through? This movie holds some of the most clever lines and amazing conversational acting that will stimulate even the most deep-thinker's philisophical outlook on life. Like a "Pirates of the Caribbean" for adults (this movie, by the way, is not one for the kids) it has action, drama, suspense, romance, and laughs right to the very end. A necessity, plain and simple.</comment>

    <title>Best Television Show Out There...</title>
    <comment>I for one am a picky buyer and more so a picky TV watcher. When I stumbled across "Supernatural" one night, I was hooked from the first blood curdling scream of terror.. This show was uniquely different, having a sense of purpose amdist these stupid, "turn-your-brain-off" shows that have plagued the television screen. This show is about the relationship of two brothers and their sacrifices made to save the innocent from Evil Forces that walk the earth. Here you might think "Oh god not something like this AGAIN.." but its more original than you think and there's much more to the story... Sam and Dean are two brothers we follow throughout the series. Both characters are written to be so real like.. they have demsion and charisma along with every human emotion. These two brothers are Hunters; a person who hunts down ghosts, beings, demons, anything you can think of. The Series takes Mythological stories, folklore, legends etc and puts them in reality. For example, Bloody Mary, ghosts, polterguists, vampires, wendigos, psychics, HH. Holmes, Robert Johnson's Deal Legend, Croatoan, Shape shifters or dopplegangers, werewolves, and the Hookman.. Those are a taste of what is involved. Not only do we see the myths come to life but we also see the lives of two extrodinary brothers play out. We see their pain, their happiness, their dedication to those in the dark about the Supernatural and their struggle with keeping true to themselves as they fight for the survival of life as the "Living" know it. Watch out, All H3ll is about to break loose... Come on in.. the water is bloody.</comment>

    <comment>I personaly played the beta and i can tell you, if you loved halo"s balance and you also love the fast pace action of Halo 2's online muiltiplayer, then Halo 3 will be the game to have. Halo 3 will have 4 player online co-op, 1st player will be master chief, the 2nd the arbiter, and the other 2 are special forces elites. Plain and simple if you own a 360, this game is a must have.</comment>

    <title>Another great product from Microsoft</title>
    <comment>Once again Microsoft has proven that they deliver. Not only was Publisher easy to install, it is a dream to work with. Putting together and publishering newsletters and other documents is a dream. The interface follows the Office tradition and for anyone one familiar with any MS Office product, Publisher will seem like an old friend. The best PC based desktop publishing software I have ever used. I reccommend it to anyone who is serious about professional presentation of their work.</comment>

    <title>Good for Some Laughs</title>
    <comment>Pretty standard Will Ferell slapstick comedy. Felt a lot like Talledega Nights on ice, with a lot of predictable shots taken at the sport of ice skating. All in all though I found myself laughing throughout most of the movie, and some of the one-liners are pretty priceless. It's definitely worth seeing once or twice but I don't think it's by any means a "classic" as far as comedies go.</comment>

    <title>Good for the Non-Gamer</title>
    <comment>This game is very basic with a pretty entertaining premise - shoot the chickens. While it might be a little dull for the advanced Wii-er or video game connoisseur it's a great way to get adjusted with the Wii system for beginners or to allow even the least experienced beginner a chance at getting in on the game action. The graphics are pretty basic but entertaining and I think it adds enough of a challenge without becoming too overwhelming for a beginner.</comment>

    <title>Best laundry Room Addition</title>
    <comment>I recently purchased this laundry work surface to protect the tops of my new washer and dryer. It has turned out to be the best new addition to my laundry room. It prevents small items from falling in the space between washer and dryer, provides an excellent work surface for folding and sorting, is an incentive to my family to fold each load as it comes out of the dryer, is easy to clean and gives the room a neat flowing appearance.</comment>

    <title>Great Blender</title>
    <comment>I purchased this blender mostly to make smoothies. I have tried several other brands of blenders and smoothie makers, but always had clumps or chunks in my smoothies. This blender completely blends everything to a wonderful consistency. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was too clean. It has a special setting so that you can put dishwashing soap in and fill it with water, and it blends around and cleans the entire inside thouroughly. My teenagers even love it, they can make their own shakes, malts and blizzard like treats to the perfect consistency. It also works as a food processor, so you have less applainces to deal with and store. It looks nice and is used so often that it just stays out on the counter. No need to hide it away in the cabinets. I highly recommend this blender.</comment>

    <title>Best Razr Charger and cheap!</title>
    <comment>This was a great find, verus buying another charger through Motorola or Sprint. Its awesome too because the head is adjustable, so you can adjust it to fit the space where your plugin is located. Also, the light changes to blue when it's plugged in and charging, so you know it's connected.</comment>

    <comment>Call of Duty 2 is better than this game. In the story mode it's the exact same thing over and over, just with different scenery. The multi-player mode is still a lot of fun, but if you already have Call of Duty 2 than you should just stick with that.</comment>

    <title>It may not be Heaven, but it is a great DVD !!</title>
    <comment>This is an excellent DVD. Much better than I expected, and I had high hopes. This material is very strong - all great songs. The presentation and camera work are outstanding.The pacing of the show is well done, the show flows well, and the songs are so good, you don't think about the fact that many are fairly long songs. The hightlight, of course is the song H + H - super version of this fantastic track. The encore of Neon Knights is very well done.Every song here is very well done. All 4 guys very strong. Dio seems surprised at the enthusiastic audience reaction to the Dio-era only song list. If you any kind of Sabbath fan you should get this DVD!!!!</comment>

    <comment>Hip Hop is resurected. Thanks, Kanye. Just where you'd expect Kanye to pick up where "Late Registration" left off. Even the artwork is progressive in nature from the last record. Really, besides the T-Pain and Lil' Wayne cameo's I give it a 5 star rating. If 4.8 were an option I'd do that, on part of the aformentioned Pain and Wayne cameos. All in all a stellar outro to the Collegiate record series Kanye's produced.</comment>

    <comment>The Family Guy Series/Show is a very funny, insightful comedy which pokes fun at much at our society. It will offend some, but if you have a good sense of humor and find the absurdness of of our general wide-spread &amp; (I believe misplaced) awe of actors,athletes and politicians funny, you will love this show.</comment>

    <comment>This is the only brand that I found that was manufactured to the size that we needed for our new 5 burner stove top. This product couldn't be any easier to use. My husband absolutely loves the pre-set buttons for items like reheating a cup of coffee or popping microwave popcorn with one touch and not burning the popcorn. I love the way it automatically turns on and opens the vent when in use.</comment>

    <comment>In the beginning this game was a bit difficult to get the hang of, but once you do it's great! It's challenging enough that you won't get bored easily and it's always fun to see what recipe you unlock next. Two player mode is great and lots of fun as well. I also love all of the different ways the wii remote is used in the game.</comment>

    <title>What Happened?</title>
    <comment>After reading reviews linked under this cd title i have come to the conclusion that there are a lot of true 50 fans out there that are unable to admit when he releases something sub-par. I saw one person say somethinig about how Jay Z will never top reasonable doubt and 50 will never top get rich or die tryin'. duh. i think pretty much everyone knows that, however, would it be so much to ask for his new cd to be better than the massacre? that doesn't seem like so much to ask to me. however, this cd isn't even as good as the massacre. 50 has fallen off. i dont know if it is that he is constantly trying to top get rich or die tryin' (which can't be done) or what. the bottom line is that in the past few years, other artists have risen up, their albums are waited on and sought after because people know it will be good, better than the last. for example : T.I., Lil Wayne and yes, Kanye. After listening to both of these cds there is really no question which cd is better. I am not anti 50 whatsoever either, so when reading this review dont think that. I used to be a huge 50 fan and have defended him and his music many tiimes, but when it comes to this i just cant. The songs started leaking months ago and i got each one that leaked and just thought to myself, that's ok, this song wasnt that good but the next one will be. However, they never got better. Where as, everythinig that kanye has released so far and on the new cd is fire. That is the bottom line. Production, beats, lyrics and flow are all better on Graduation than on Curtis. It may not even be fair to compare these two as they come from two different ends of the Hip Hop spectrum but since someone decided to then here it is. And as for all of you die hard G-Unit fans on here talkinig up 50 and this cd, i would just stop now and get behind Buck and wait for his next cd because he is taking G-Unit over. You want a fair comparison, compare Curtis to Buck the World. Same style, same group, and Curtis won't win that battle either. Buy Kanye. Save your money by not buying Curtis.</comment>

    <title>sure-fire hit!</title>
    <comment>Frank Miller's graphic novel is brought to the screen in beautiful form with 300. With highly-stylized environments and fight sequences, the film really plays as a graphic novel brought to life. The world of 300 is vivid and at times purely awesome, and the action does not disappoint, with slow motion effects and gritty battles. The performances are well done, but one thing that bothered me personally was the Scottish accent of the actor portraying Leonides. It is not so heavy, however, to distract from the film, but is noticeable enough to stand out a bit. The narration is nicely done and the soundtrack is great, adding dimension to the film as a whole. The extras DVD could stand a bit more features than what is included, but in all is an interesting addition. I highly recommend this film.</comment>

    <title>Flavor of Love 2</title>
    <comment>Great DVD, lots of fun to watch, esspecially if you are a fan of the show, the only problem I have with the whole set is that the reunion show is not on it, and thats one of the best parts of the whole show. I was really looking foreward to seeing the fight between ALL of the girls and New York Un-Cut, but alas, it wasn't there. DVD should be remade with the reunion included.</comment>

    <title>david lynch's latest masterpiece</title>
    <comment>first of all, this may not be your film if have not enjoyed any of david lynch's other films or if you are just a casual film. also, you may wish to try blue velvet or elephant man if you are just exploring lynch works for the first time. others will know exactly what i'm talking about when i say this is david in all his glory. inland empire isn't exceptionally violent but it will disturb &amp; take you out of your comfort zone. this is a 3 hour assault on the senses &amp; you may even feel a bit drained when the credits begin to roll. having said that, i loved it but it helped me to have seen almost all of david's other work first to appreciate this one. this is perhaps one of his most avantguard, surreal pieces of expressionism to date. there is almost no middle ground here either. you will love it or you will hate it. however, be prepared that the film isn't formulaic in any sense of the word &amp; all bets are off not unlike lost highway or mulholland drive. once the film takes off, many viewers may be left in the dust. as with just about any lynch films, there are no simple answers or explanations for the things that happen in the film &amp; are best left up to the viewer's interpretation. laura dern gives one of the finest performances of her career. if there were any justic in this world, she would've received atleast an oscar nomination for this brave performance.</comment>

    <title>Good Movie But Bad Quality DVD</title>
    <comment>The movie is funny (although admittedly not as funny as "Shaun of the Dead"), BUT, be careful when buying the DVD. I purchased it and at certain points in the film, the picture would freeze, and not continue to play unless I ejected the disk, put it back in my player, and then skipped past the scene. I borrowed a friend's copy and it did the same thing. My player doesn't do this with any other DVDs, so I think the company that made the DVDs might have made an assembly line mistake. Maybe they have fixed it by now and newer copies work properly.</comment>

    <title>fun game</title>
    <comment>I'm a huge guitar hero fan. I love the first 2 games. I went into this knowing it was basically just an expansion of the first 2. It's fun, I would have liked to have seen some of the heavier stuff from the 80's on there (megadeth, metallica, even slayer) instead of Pop songs like We got the beat etc... overall worth it for fans of the series.</comment>

    <title>Great deal</title>
    <comment>3 of the funniest movies in one set.. How can you go wrong?? Only complaint is 2 of the movies (The 'Burbs and Dragnet) are only in 2 channel audio. Not a big deal since neither of them are action movies but it would have been nice to have the rear channels used for something.</comment>

    <title>Great TV series</title>
    <comment>TV series based on the movie by Joss Whedon. If you've never seen the series, it's worth a blind buy. The DVDs contain all 12 episodes of the first season. It's not jam-packed with extra features, but does include commentaries for some episodes, and other special features.</comment>

    <title>Best Charger Ever!</title>
    <comment>Dynex should be the standard for iPods. Honestly. This charger was not only reasonably priced, but it is is a true gift for iPods. First off, this charger is better than just plugging in your iPod with the USB cord into your computer. iPods tend to slow down PCs, and because of that, a non-inserting charger is a perfect way to charge your iPod without slowing down your work on your computer. Second, since it's a USB cord and a seperate piece, you can still use it as a second cord for your charging and updating purposes. Lastly, this charger shuts down once the full charge is done. The LED light will shut off and so will the charger, in turn not over-charging your iPod. Overall, this charger should be included with iPods. It's the best!</comment>

    <comment>I've played a lot of games before, but this one is by far one of the best games ever. If you have played Dance Dance Revelusion before...this is the same thing BUT WAY COOLER, and this is for lazy people that only want to use their fingers! Great Game! Buy it!</comment>

    <comment>This set of Season 3 DVDs for Desperate Housewives can be judged by its great packaging. The episodes are great as ever! If you're a Desperate Housewives fan -- you should definitely purchase this product. I watched it with an open mouth half of the time, cried 1/4, and laughed the other 1/4. It's just an all around great DVD set.</comment>

    <comment>Jam Session...that is what this album should have been called. Ms Badu seems as though she went into the studio and just started playing music and this was the fininshed product. I Loved it from beginning to end, with songs that will make you think this was live. Ms Badu is just amazing.</comment>

    <title>Clever &amp; Appropriate</title>
    <comment>This is a good show for the whole family. It has action, mystery, adventure, and comedy, but no explicit language nor nudity! We really enjoyed each episode! Great action shots of stunts done with all kinds of moving vehicles! The plots are good with clever twists, and the main three actors are great together!!! Although they are Stuntmen &amp; a Stuntwoman for the movies, they take cases, on the side, for the L. A. court system as Bounty Hunters. It's interesting how they bring "Bail Jumpers" to justice by using their common sense and stunt expertise! They have fun and friendship, but a businesslike relationship. The music is classic, not dated or uninteresting. It doesn't lose any appeal with the passing of time, like many old TV shows. An All-Time Favorite!</comment>

    <title>Amazing Jack Johnson film</title>
    <comment>Only being introduced to Jack Johnson about a two years ago, I have quickly absorbed almost every one of his songs. On this DVD, they all come alive with fantastic cinematography, insightful interviews with Jack and his friends, and just the atmosphere of the crowd as they appreciate every single song that's played. A must-own for any Jack Johnson enthusiast!</comment>

    <title>Not quite what was expected... But Nostalgic.</title>
    <comment>I thought this movie might be a little more exciting or at least engrossing... It's more like 2 episodes combined into 1 movie. On the "Plus" side - The best thing about the story line is it's told on a much more personal scale. The cast is pretty small so the B5 Station seems pretty empty. The visual/special effects are very cool. A couple of the Special features were kind of cool too. There's one with JMS doing a Sock Puppet version of a couple characters that's silly but, Funny. If you're a big fan of the series, then I would recommend getting this dvd JUST for the Memorial Tributes to Ambassador G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) and Dr. Steven Franklin (Richard Biggs) that might even bring a tear to your eye.</comment>

    <comment>EA continues the evolution of NCAA Football. The gameplay is very similar to prior years with some additions. I don't care for the first person kickoff return view or the same 'ol schtick from Corso, et. al. but hey, you can make a dominating team via dynasty mode and really play ball.</comment>

    <title>oustanding voice...</title>
    <comment>This young lady is a radiant combination of Jennifer Lopez and Rihanna giving her a well distinguished and versatile sound that instantly grabs your attention and never let's go. The English Spanish mix on a variety of the tracks (also three bonus tracks completely in Spanish) shows her ability to draw in different walks of life. "Run The Show" is a prime example of the English Spanish lyrical assault. The tempo is brilliant, bubbly and very up beat. The additional reggae esque rhymes by Shaka Dee also add some spice to the song. "Am I Dreaming" is a very pop oriented track with a soothing and relaxing beat. The lyrics are romantic and very picturesque. The hook is contagious and her voice shines showing her vocal range. The heavily played radio smash "Whine Up" featuring Elephant Man has the edgy and hypnotic club banging beat. Elephant Man slings some fierce reggae induced rhymes adding fuel to this already scorching hot track. A slow piano played "Love Me, Leave Me" is emotion powered and sends your mind on a journey while it soaks in the passionate lyrics being blissfully sung. This young lady is destined for greatness and will rapidly grow in the hearts of many.</comment>

    <comment>Great inexpensive way to get new Office program offerings. New Word and Excel take little getting to, but it's a good update from my old Office 2000. Only regret is that Outlook is not included in this version.</comment>

    <title>Wonderful Product</title>
    <comment>I have purchased at least 4 of these Samsung Replacement Water Filters since I bought my Samsung Side-By-Side Refrigerator. The filters are easy to change and the instructions with the filter are easy to understand. My water and ice are clean and without the original taste of my well water. I would definitely recommend this replacement water filter.</comment>

    <title>Favorite Series purchase of this year</title>
    <comment>Heroes Season 1 is by far the best entertainment investment we've made this year. It has tons of extras and each time you watch it you notice more details, different things come to life each episode. I definitly would recommend this to both people who have already seen Heroes when it was on tv and people who haven't see it at all. It's truely like watching a mini movie each episode. Picture and sound quality is great even if you don't have the best entertainment system it doesn't matter because its so well made, it makes for a fun, action filled friday night! Its an outstanding series i'd reccomend it to everyone. Quality</comment>

    <title>Critics are not you.</title>
    <comment>So I bought this game yesterday. And IGN is extremely exaggerating. The one main thing I can find a an issue with control wise is simply the 180 degree turn. It works about 75% of the time. Other then that the flying is fine... its not spectacular, but it fine. The lock on system... works about 99% of the time or more for me. Maybe the people at IGN were trying to lock on from like a mile away, where at that point, any enemy object on your screen is a potential lock point. Seriously, it works fine. The story is pretty good, the acting and music are fantastic. I am about 3/4 of the way through the game and I have enjoyed it alot actually. The visuals are breath taking and sound is delivered in 7.1 DD or downscaled 5.1 DD for most systems. If I had to grade it on what I have played so far... (1 to 10 scale) Graphics: 10 Story: 9 Gameplay: 7 Music: 10 Replay: 7 Overall: 7.5 - 8.0 roughly (not AVG) The game is good... much better then a 4.9/10 or 5.1/10 given to it by so called "Game Experts". If you have a PS3, buy it or rent it, I am glad I did. Seriously, there are games that have had much worse control issues then this game.</comment>

    <title>good, but the 40th anniversary dvd looks better</title>
    <comment>First off: The Graduate is a fantastic film. One of the best films ever about growing up and finding your place in the world. Unfortunatly this dvd doesn't do the film justice because it's non-anamorphic, and the only bonus feature is the theatrical trailer. I'll deffinetly be getting the 40th Anniversary dvd.</comment>

    <title>Another Guitar Hero</title>
    <comment>This is basically just a song pack for Guitar Hero. As such it's nice to have a bunch of new songs. Unfortunately, it has less unlockables than previous iterations and there could have been some more 80's rock songs over the 80's pop they selected. This isn't really worth $50 but I got it for $40 + a $15 gift certificate which was well worth it.</comment>

    <title>You need this one!</title>
    <comment>Its very simple if you are a 50 Cent fan, you will be very happy. If you didn't like the two first singles "Amusement Park" and "Straight to Bank" don't worry this album sounds nothing like that (although unfortunately they are included). If you liked "Get Money" and "Ayo Technology" then you will really like this. Far from his best but it is the usual 50 album - a little long, very violent, a little love, alot bragging. Enjoy!</comment>

    <title>Come Now Sleep a new triumph for As Cities Burn</title>
    <comment>Between the release of "Son, I Loved You At Your Darkest" and "Come Now Sleep," As Cities Burn underwent some line-up changes. On "Come Now Sleep" guitarist, Cody Bonnette stepped up to replace TJ Bonnette on vocals. While this presents a different sound it offers no less emotion and intensity behind the vocals. For those who enjoyed the screaming aspect of "Son, I Loved You at Your Darkest," you may be disappointed in "Come Now Sleep." Musically and lyrically, however, "Come Now Sleep" is no disappointment. Musically it is well produced and driven. Lyrically it is enough to draw anyone into the arms of the Father's mercy. Songs such as "Empire" speak to our righteousness and glory in Christ. "This is It" reminds us of the futile attempt at survival unless we are caught up in the winds of grace. The entire CD is overflowing with this kind of lyrical depth. I cannot encourage anyone enough to go buy it. I am hard-pressed to give this CD my top rating of 2007 thus far. I am extremely blessed by this CD and pray you will be as well.</comment>

    <title>Worth watching again and again</title>
    <comment>This DVD set is a great buy for anyone looking to for side-splittingly funny material. The set includes all the episodes from season One and Two along with commetary for some and a brief synopsis for each. It is definitely a DVD with replay value. My wife and I watched all the episodes right away and now are on our second and third viewings within a month of buying it. It is terrific in the sheer simplicity of some of its humor but I especially love the jokes that require some wit or thought to get. I would recommend to anyone!</comment>

    <title>From the minute you watch this show you're hooked!</title>
    <comment>I saw this show when it first premiered on the wb and I admit I didnt like it. I thought it was kind of boring and I just couldnt get into it. Then my sister started saying dude you have to watch it omg you will love it and I said nah looks dumb i'll stick with csi. Well one day I was at my sisters and she forced me to watch an episode. I have to say this is the best thing she ever did because it really sparked my interest and then I started watching it more and more at home and before I knew it I couldnt go a week without watching it. I love how they incorperate the family dynamics and really show how the characters are growing and have grown and you really become attached to them and add some ghosts, demons, and the occasional vampire or werewolf and that makes this show really unique. Another thing I love is that all of the things they come face to face with which we think only exists in our nightmares are based on real folklore and legends and you can search for them right on google, so in a way it kind of makes you wonder maybe there is the possibility that there is more out there then we know about. And of course these boys, Jensen and Jared, have such good on screen and off screen chemistry that sometimes you have to really remind yourself that these are in fact not brothers. So yeah, all in all you should buy this and join those who have seen how good of a show this is and are trying to spread the word. Speaking of that if you do like this show then email the cw and tell them so they dont cancel it!!! Ok my ramble is done lol.</comment>

    <title>Wish all tv shows were this good</title>
    <comment>I could use just one word to describe the first season of Rome -- brilliant! HBO spent their money wisely in producing this series. Bruno Heller is a wonderful writer and he has created compelling characters in Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo. Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson (respectively) bring both characters to life and by the end of the first few episodes you feel as if you've known them forever. Other actors are also at the top of their game whether you're talking about Ciaran Hinds as Caesar, James Purefoy as Marc Anthony, Polly Walker as Atia or any of the others. Even bit players like the herald who reads out declarations in the Forum leave their mark with you as the season progresses. The sets and costumes for the show are amazingly well done and the attention to detail is probably the best I've ever seen in a TV show. Make sure to watch the specials on the DVD to fully comprehend the scale of the whole production. One outstanding feature of the DVDs is the segment titled All Roads Lead to Rome which gives you greater detail on various items, gods and goddesses and the culture of ancient Rome. This feature along with the commentaries by historical consultant Johnathan Stamp make this first season of Rome a must have for any collection.</comment>

    <title>one of the better PS3 titles yet</title>
    <comment>Great graphics, great sound, solid story line, solid game. The controls of this game take time to become accustomed too, so be patient. I found myself trying to use the analog stick/s several times. I would recommend not only playing through all of the training ground options, but also replaying one or two of the first few mission several times (training and battle missions differ greatly). Once you get the feel for the Sixaxis the game is increasingly enjoyable.</comment>

    <title>The Best of Tank</title>
    <comment>In true Tank fashion, he delivers with an amazing album. Although he hasn't released an album in five years, he shows us that he's been hard at work. My favorite track is #4 - Please Don't Go. Tank shows us that his experiences are the same as ours on this cut. This is truly a must have for any music collection.</comment>

    <title>Powerful, Easy to use SW - MS Office</title>
    <comment>Microsoft Office has been evolving steadily in each release. Office 2007 has powerful features and templates in Powerpoint, Word and Excel that make it exceptionally great. The new context smart ribbon is new and useful. For instance, when you change styles (and now there are more style templates and Word Art and powerpoint templates), you will see the changes automatically in the doc as you change your style. This is very useful to determine which style you want to select. You can also get rid of the ribbon, if you wish and go back to the Office 2003 look. The new Powerpoint is also awesome.</comment>

    <title>Okay purchase</title>
    <comment>I bought this set in hopes to get a good workout while learning how to strip tease. The first two DVDs are really good. I probably should have just bought those two seperate. The others are okay. They are not too long of workout/dances either. Maybe an extra hour or so on each would have been good. Overall, I am glad I bought it for the first two DVDs. I learned a couple cute moves and am really enjoying my workout.</comment>

Instead of having just your usual dose of tragedy and blood-sucking, you get a little side dish of comedy and the crazy emotions of the young vampire girl Hazuki. With wonderful animation, and some of the most creatively directed scenes (great coloration as well) the only thing stopping someone from buying all the rest of the series will be their wallet:)</comment>

    <title>Greatest show on Television</title>
    <comment>I was very skeptical on this show! I seen one espisode from season 2 and I will own every season that comes out that will be purchased from best buy. I just ordered season 1 online from Best Buy. The Second and third seasons are sure to be coming my way. I would recommend this TV series to everyone.</comment>

    <title>Great Video Game to Movie</title>
    <comment>This movie was great!!! It is one of those movies you can watch over and over. The action thru the movie was nonstop. The addition of Alice to the Resident Evil series has added so much more then the Resident Evil series had to offer before. This movie is a keeper.</comment>

    <title>Great Low-Cost Bose Solution</title>
    <comment>These multi-purpose speakers are labeled as Bookshelf speakers, but they deliver performance consistent with higher priced BOSE products. Great sound and style that fits with most any home decor. In fact, I use these are rear surrounds for a 5.1 system. Sure, they're slightly bulky, but sexy enough to look nice no matter where you put them. Design is perfect for flexible placement with any third party speaker stands.</comment>

    <title>One of the most interesting movies I've ever seen</title>
    <comment>This movie has a very cool flow to it. It reminds me of Amorres Perros (another great movie) where it interweaves tales of all these peoples lives. It is neat how they all meet somehow. Well made film techniques and lighting was great! I would recommend this film to everyone.</comment>

    <title>favourite worst nightmare</title>
    <comment>if their first CD was a 10, this album is a 9.9. not every song is amazing, but the majority are. the songs that are amazing are some of their best work yet. best songs include brianstorm, teddy picker, fluorescent adolescent, balaclava, if you where there beware, yellow bricks, and 505. definitely a must have album. one of the best sophomore albums in recent history.</comment>

    <comment>This movie is one of the only movies of it's kind to take animation, and combine it in depth to make a genuine film noir detective movie. The special effects are amazing, so much so that you won't notice all the detail first time through. The special features include several documentaries and some very interesting interviews regarding how they made it and how they almost didn't on several occasions. This is a must own if you are an animation fan.</comment>

    <title>The Golden Girls....</title>
    <comment>I just wish to share my thoughts with you on this classic 80's sitcom. I just love the fifth thru seventh season of the golden girls more so then the other seasons but I do own all 180 episodes which is the whole show. I am 31 years old and the jokes and Quotes from the show are still a kick in the pants all out laughter. I really know when I am feeling down &amp; out I can get a few episodes out from any season and have pleanty of laughs. Let the cheesecake out of the firdge with everything else and start eatin. I would love to meet Betty White and Bea Arthur, just can't get enough of either of them. thanks, Orion4326</comment>

    <title>Great Film</title>
    <comment>When I first found out about this movie, all I could think about is how Chris Nolan(director), Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were delaying production on Batman Begins 2 aka The Dark Knight. After seeing this film and subsequently buying this film my mind has been changed. This is a very well written, cast, directed and acted movie. Bale and Jackman were great together, Nolan delivers another great film and Scarlett Johansson is a beautiful as ever. I highly recommend this film, if you were on the fence about it don't be, its a great movie that doesn't disappoint</comment>

    <comment>This is one funny movie! If you're a Will Ferrell fan, this dvd is a must! You get all kinds of hillarious bonus material. The best bonus stuff is the gag reel and the deleted scenes. It's great seeing how Chazz was an orphan too &amp; that Mr. MacElroy was going to adopt him, until he spotted Jimmy ice skating. Another good part is seeing the other songs that Chazz sings while on the treadmill, besides "My Humps". Buy this dvd!!</comment>

    <title>Magnificent</title>
    <comment>Tell All Your Friends is most enjoyed with sufficient analysis. This CD tells the story of a ill fated relationship through the eyes of a narrator who finds himself simultaneously reflecting on and living through the horrors of a relationship. The narrator through out the tale is at varying levels of despair, anger, longing, regret, and (perhaps surprisingly) self confidence and determination. Track 1-You Know How I Do The tale begins with the central relationship flailing. "SO SICK so sick of being tired and OH SO TIRED of being sick". The culpability of each party is immediately questioned: "We're BOTH such magnificent liars...". The self-confidence/determination motif of the album is introduced front and center with the refrain: "WE WONT STAND FOR HAZY EYES ANYMORE". Track 2-Bike Scene The narrator has moved to action in this song "I'll leave the lights down low so she knows I MEAN BUSINESS and maybe we could talk this over". He also retains hope "I COULD BE YOUR BEST BET" although it is tempered with fear "LET ALONE YOUR WORST EX". By the end of the song we know the tables have turned and it is not our narrator with the power in the situation "YOU'VE GOT ME RIGHT WHERE YOU WANT ME" Track 3- Cute without the "e" (Cut from the Team) With the narrator still in the villain's clutches we are treated to one of my favorite TBS songs as the narrator muses about the nature of his conundrum: "And will you TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS you've got your gun to my head....THIS ALL WAS ONLY WISHFUL THINKING". Also-importantly-we begin to compile a list of the villain's misdeeds: "Your lipstick, his collar don't bother angel I know exactly what goes on"; "I wont ever ask if you don't ever tell me I know you well enough to know you never loved me'; (more specifically) "AND ALL OF THIS WAS ALL YOUR FAULT"...."I stay WRECKED and JEALOUS for this". After cute without the e when know the narrator has been wronged and that his transgressor is not done yet... Track 4-Theres no I in Team This song moves away from the central relationship to friendship heartbreak-pains which are just as damning. Learning that "BEST FRIENDS MEANS I PULLED THE TRIGGER BEST FRIENDS MEANS YOU GET WHAT YOU DESERVE" makes us question who the people are that we let into our lives....As unloving girlfriends cheat what are our friends up to behind our backs? Track 5-Great Romances of the 21st Century Back to the central relationship-and things have gotten worse. "I said 'this wont mean a thing come tomorrow' and that's exactly how I'll make it seem cause Im still not sleepin thinkin 'i've crawled home from worse than this'". Although the narrator is slowly crumbling inside there is still optimistic resolve "I NEVER SAID ID TAKE THIS LYING DOWN". The song ends with the narrator begging for positive reinforcement for his efforts....... Track 6-Ghost Man on Third The title alone implies the narrator's feelings: he is now a ghost. This song is much more vague than many of the others but it still conjures up the necessary mood. The narrator is waiting for her and knows she is not coming. He begins to rebel against the tides of fate. Track 7-Timberwolves at New Jersey "...that's what girls dreams are made of...and that's all you need to know you have it or you don't" "THIS IS ME WITH THE WORDS ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE AND MY EYE DOWN THE SCOPE OF THE BARREL OF A GUN....remind me not to ever act this way again/remind me not to ever think of you again". What does it take to get girls? What do we put ourselves through to impress them? The narrator is trying to find validation with those other than the villain and is not finding much luck. **Also notice the many gun references Track 3- "which would you prefer my finger on the TRIGGER or me face down down across your floor JUST SO LONG AS THIS THINGS LOADED...will you tell all your friends you've got your GUN to my head?" Track 4- "best friends means I pulled the TRIGGER best friends means you get what you deserve" TRACK 7-"this is me with the words on the tip of my tongue and my eye through the scope down the BARREL OF A GUN" Timberwovles at New Jersey is a very important turning point in the story. The narrator is fed up, he feels like he does not exist (is a ghost), that he is not okay (you have it or you DONT), and he's in so much danger that it is comparable to staring down the barrel of a gun....he decides something must change. Track 8-The Blue Channel "This is the last night that you'll be keeping secrets from me." proclaims the angry narrator who continues to be wronged: "you know of the TEN MILLION THINGS YOU HAD TO SAY 'sorry' just might found its way there somehow, somewhere". Unfortunately, as is often the case, the narrator still desires the attention he was never given: "If this is the LAST TIME I see you, I'll STILL wait for your call". As a final jab to the heart: "Do you know what your girl's been up to?" The narrator and listener are well aware of the situation's magnitude: the cheating, loveless villain still has the power to raise our hopes and lower our spirits, we know she is evil and now have the pleasure of milling over it for eternity.... Track 9-You're SO Last Summer "She said 'don't, don't let go to your head. boys like you are a dime a dozen. boys like you are a dime a dozen." she said 'you're a touch overrated. you're a lush and I hate it but these grass stains on my knees they won't mean a thing" With the wounds still fresh a generous serving of salt is poured on top with the villain showing no remorse and instead making audacious counterclaims. Sadly the narrator still cannot completely remove himself from the horrendous woman "maybe I should hate you for this...never really did ever quite get that far". Most importantly this song holds one of the most classic lyrics of all time SO amazing in fact that I cannot in good conscience ruin them for someone considering buying the CD. The song begs "All I need to know is that I'm something you'll be missing....". The narrator hates the villain knows her crimes but still needs to know that he meant SOMETHING to her. Track 10-Head Club Life Changing Anthem. The story resolves itself and I wont say how. But our hero triumphs and so does the listener.... been through a break up? had your heart broken? been made to feel you are worthless? buy this cd</comment>

    <comment>This is like one of the most anticipated DVD's this years, Transformers is a feast for the eyes. This two-disc set has everything that a die hard Transformers wants and newbies new to this amazing, spectualar film can learn from in depth commentary by acclaimed director Michael Bay to featurettes on the visual and special effects. Although, I been waiting for this DVD to finally come out since its release in July, trust me, it's well worth the wait. DON'T JUST SIT THERE, MAN. PREODRDER NO BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.</comment>

    <title>Best PSP Game To Date</title>
    <comment>This is the best game ever made for the PSP. It uses the PSP's unique style and controls perfectly. I think that this will have many more offspring games(GTA:Vice City Stories) in the future. It gives you so much freedom. Even though it is identical to GTA III, just with a different title, it is still an amazing game. This will deffinatly go down as one of the greatest games ever put onto the PSP, plus you can play against other players around the nation through the WI-FI online capability in games like Survivor: Chicago, Ultimate Death + Destruction and many more online games. Deffinatly a must-have.</comment>

Frustrated, I called the vendor, then my ISP, and determined that Murphy got me again. Don't install new Internet hardware/software on Sunday, when apparently everyone does maintenance/upgrades. Today, everything went perfectly and our new 300 Mbps network is working great! Vendor support was good, manual and quick start instructions were the best I've seen on any computer related hardware - I can even read it in English! I rate this product and the associated laptop wireless card an A+.</comment>

    <title>Funniest Movie Ever</title>
    <comment>Being a teen i love hits to the groin. This movie is chock full of them, not to mention alot of people taking balls to the face(lol). Personally, Justin Long is my favorite actor so i love anything he's in, but this has to be the funniest movie of all time. Ben Stiller plays the most idiotic person ever. His stupidity alone is reason enough to see this movie. For Me, it has become more of a cult following. I practically worship this movie. Everyone on Earth should see it. Buy It !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</comment>

    <title>Best Movie Ever Made</title>
    <comment>Although This Movie Is Highly Unlikely, it's still awesome. I obviously adore justin Long, who stars in this movie, so this movie is great for me. But that's not the only reason. I have one word for you: Glen. This character makes the movie. Without him it wouldn't be nearly as funny. Delivering lines such as "Battle Royal", You will be rolling on the floor laughing. This movie is incredible and should be part of everyone's dvd collection. And it's not just for teenagers, my parents Love this movie too!!</comment>

    <title>This is the Year that sold the show to the viewers</title>
    <comment>The first year was good, but this was the year that sold the show to the public. Some of the most interesting shows were shown this year. Plus the inter-action between Fox and Scully was drawn out more. From this year for the next few years the show was bound to take flight. This was the year of the Flukeman, the thing living in the sewers. The abduction of Scully, the intro to Alex Krycek, the alian shape-shifting bounty hunter, the beginning of making Canser man a real part of the show. Of course a great season ending show, that you have to buy season 3 to see the end of.</comment>

    <title>Superb Epic Sci-Fi!</title>
    <comment>This set starts an incredible ride that spans 5 seasons. Babylon 5 tells the story of the crew and denizens of the last Babylon station and how they all become embroiled in an epic struggle for the fate of the universe. In-depth writing, excellent character development and conflicts both personal and galactic in nature drive this show from beginning to end. Season 1 sets up the remaining 4 seasons. Characters are introduced and thrown into situations that test their mettle leaving some permanently changed. If you like either Sci-Fi or great writing you owe it to yourself to buy this set. Once you finish season 1 you wont be able to wait for season 2.</comment>

    <comment>Graphics are awesome, best I have seen for any system. Sound is awesome, gameplay is awesome. Controls take sometime to get use to. There are training levels so you can get use to the controls. Overall this game is one of the best for ps3. If you don't like the sirxais control you better get use to it, because motion controls are going to be the future of video games</comment>

    <comment>This game did not really change from madden 07. There are new moves and online playing is better. I would recomend this game for anyone that is looking to upgrade from 06 or 05 or just to get new rosters. Even if you are not upgrading it is nice game to play.</comment>

    <title>one of the best DVDs released this year</title>
    <comment>With fascinating performance, beautiful musical score, and twisted while clever story line, "The prestige" is undeniably one of the best movies. The movie starts out a bit confusing, with numerous names to keep tract of and it does constantly shift back and forth between the present and the past. However, after 15 minutes or so it'll have your full attention and you won't even realize the movie is about to finish in the end. Depends on how much you think during the movie, you'll likely to be pondering or discussing the ending or even backtract through what happened. All in all, a great flick and an awesome addition for all you movie collectors. High recommended!</comment>

    <comment>Scorsese does a great job directing this film. It's his best work since Goodfellas.It's about an undercover cop who gains a mobster's trust, while a criminal inflirates the police. Staring a great cast it's a classic all the way.</comment>

    <title>Great sound, but bulky</title>
    <comment>These sound great and work fine with very little distortion or static in sound. The head strap is the on/off switch which sometimes depending on how your laying can get in the way and kick itself off and on but overall not that bad of a problem. I just hope it doesn't wear out quick?</comment>

    <title>"A movie that deserves to be seen at least twice!"</title>
    <comment>This film is truly amazing. It is not like any other hollywood movie. It feels real, which is important to a film. The best thing about this film are the actors. I am a HUGE Leonardo DiCaprio fan and I think that this movie is one of his best performances! It is truly hard to watch sometimes because his portrayle of Gilbert's (Johnny Depp) mentally challenged younger brother Arnie is so real. I would recommend this film to any one as long as they have respect for people who are mentally channenged and people that are over weight "Momma". This movie is a true classic, one that deserves to be viewed at least twice! -A 16 year old girl!</comment>

    <title>Monk continues to shine</title>
    <comment>Monk Season 5 is just as good as all previous seasons, and Monk continues to be one of my all-time favorite shows to watch. All episodes are written very well, to where the audience doesn't get bored and continues to learn more about the characters, and the jokes continue to come, and seem new instead of used. Also a clean show that can be watched with the family, and all can enjoy. A great accomplishment in many aspects.</comment>

    <title>Good Follow Up To College Dropout</title>

    <title>Decent</title>
    <comment>Decent, it is basically a set of more bonus tracks that all take place in the eighties. Not a whole lot new except for some different coloring and a couple new characters, but no bonus songs. The song selections are pretty good but not near as challenging as on Guitar Hero 2. An expert level on this game would be hard on Guitar Hero 2. There is a lot of really good and somewhat challenging eighties rock music that Activision failed to include in the song list. Overall a good buy if you are really into eighties music and don't mind much of a difference from previous versions of the game</comment>

    <title>Underappreciated genius from Red Hot Chili Peppers</title>
    <comment>By The Way, officially the eighth studio album from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, is often overlooked and ignored by more hyped Chili Peppers releases such as Californication, Blood Sugar S*x Magik, and Stadium Arcadium. But don't get it twisted: this album is as good or better than anything the Red Hot Chili Peppers has ever done. The album kicks off with the title track, which is basically a microcosm of the Chili Peppers career: funky, melodic, fast and slow, loud and quiet, it's rock and roll. Then they take a slower and more peaceful approach with "This is the Place", "Dosed", "Don't Forget Me", "The Zephyr Song", "Midnight", and "Tear"; on these tracks lead singer Anthony Kiedis and guitarist John Frusciante show off their new falsetto style of singing, and surprisingly, it works. They do the exact opposite on faster, more agressive tracks such as "Can't Stop" and "Throw Away Your Television". Then there is the beautiful "I Could Die For You", which shows the maturity of the band. In my opinion, the highlights of the album are "C*bron" and "Minor Thing". "Cabron" is a salsa-esque tune that is tailor made for a summer day. While "Minor Thing" is a little piece of perfection. It's clear on By The Way that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have a plethora of talent and skills at every 'position' and they are here to stay.</comment>

    <title>Original is sometimes Best!!</title>
    <comment>I'm a Math Major and I still use the TI-83, even though new versions have come out. I believe it is simpler and easier to use. It has all you need without too many buttons or things in the way. It is a great tool for cheking your work, and it will become your best friend in all Trig, Calculus, and higher math classes.</comment>

    <title>Awesome - This one takes my breath away.</title>
    <comment>This album is a true reflection of a Jars of Clay live performance. Its truly wonderful. There is the heart and soul of the songs. These all are so very moving. Every time I hear them, I get goose bumps. Every Christian can reflect on these songs and see how they can tie into our own struggles that we go through. My favorite song is "light gives heat". I think that this song really touches any ones heart that donates their time or money to any organization that helps any child or persons in need. Jars of Clay created BloodWater mission, to provide clean food and safe blood for transfusions to those in need in Africa. You can see from the lyrics in this song that this has become a part of their lives and has affected the band on a personal level. I would recommend this cd to anyone! The only down side of it is that I wish there was more!</comment>

    <title>Best Album by This Artisit</title>
    <comment>This is one of my fav. albums by H.I.M. (His Inferenal Majesty), a band from Finland. Between the wonderful guitar solos and beautifully written lyrics-it's a sure win. You'll proably fall in love with the band from the first track to the end and you'll proably want to listen to the whole cd. There's not a song on this cd that I don't like. I highly recomend you get this album first if you're just getting into HIM.</comment>

    <title>Top of the line entertainment!</title>
    <comment>In line with Lock Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels and Trainspotting; if you like the added flair of the Brittish underbelly - this movie is for you. Throw away that "wimpy, nice guy" impression you have of Elijah Wood, because he'll stuff it down your throat! Great cast including Charlie Hunnam, and Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black). Intense.</comment>

    <title>A nice save...</title>
    <comment>This movie is great. That statement stands on its own, but is far too simple to describe how good this movie is and how it truly lives up to the Star Wars standard of movie. Episode I was an alright movie but was a big let down for many fans. The build up was impossible to live up to, but when it was released, Episode I just took away from most fans Star Wars experience. Episode II came back with a punch. In fact, it was a combo that just kept hitting hard. Anyone can appreciate an action film like this, as it was non-stop in this one. A Star Wars fan can appreciate this because it really shows us more of the Star Wars universe we know. Its good to see the overall story develop and proceed. Episode I faltered in this a little, but both seemed to be clearer when Episode III came out. Episode II was an action film that made the Star Wars experience fun again.</comment>

    <comment>Project 86 takes it their music to a whole other level with this album. There are some styles that they hit that most die hard Project 86 fans may not like but the average person will appreciate. Project 86 hits on all cylinders and there are very few weak spots on this entire album.</comment>

    <title>Favorite 360 Game</title>
    <comment>This game was one of the first I purchased for my Xbox 360 and my favorite. It's attention to detail and realistic interactions make the game so immersive. The array of weaponry and maps is fantastic and the angry shouts of the terrorists intensify the experience. The co-op is probably my favorite part, duking it out against tons of enemies is just too fun with a buddy. Definitely my favorite game on the console, and one of the prettiest and grittiest.</comment>

    <title>Wise choice for the PSP owner</title>
    <comment>I was in the market a while back for a good amount of memory for my PSP since I very much wanted to utilize the PSP's ability to play music. 4GB was definitely a satisfactory choice; it rivals most iPod Nanos in memory space. I've also found I'm able to replace my previous need for USB sticks or flash drives for school since this memory card holds any form of data and our computer labs are compatible with Pro Duos. If you're in the market for a sizable amount of memory for your PSP, camera, MP3, etc., then I would definitely recommend a 4GB Pro Duo.</comment>

    <title>Pretty Good...</title>
    <comment>I thought that this CD was pretty good. I have always been raised in a christian home and brought up listening to christian music. But now adays it is becoming much harder to listen to christian music when there is so much secular music too. I feel like Superchick has done a great job at trying to make a "cool" sound to their songs, and not only a neat sound but interesting lyrics. I liked their cd and would recommend it to friends.</comment>

    <comment>It's amazing that the Drummer from Underoath wrote and performed all the instruments on this album. He is very gifted and talented. This album is definitely not like the Underoath sound. Best two songs on the CD - Dirty and Left Out, and Amazing Because it Is......very powerful tracks! Definitely recommend for your collection.</comment>

    <title>Worth It! Bringing creativity to the mainstream</title>
    <comment>With so much junk out there in modern hip-hop, thank god for kanye. I would have liked to have seen a few more tracks, but the ones that are on there arent fillers. I'd only skip MAYBE one track on here. Initially my favorite track on here was THE GOOD LIFE. But after listening more, the best track on here is FLASHING LIGHTS (featuring Dwele - not credited on the Best Buy website). I don't HATE 50, but this whole competition has created a positive buzz for both of them, they will both benefit with more record sales. For the first time in years, people are EXCITED about BUYING albums! Kanye will be King tomorrow.</comment>

    <title>i was pleased...SHE HAS A GREAT VOICE!</title>
    <comment>I was leaving the MaryMary concert in Baltimore one night and some street hustler slung Onitsha's demo in my hand. Later when I got home I popped the CD in my player and actually liked her voice and her message. One day recently I saw her CD on the shelf and hoped that I would like the entire CD just as I liked the snippets. I did! At first I thought she sounded like Brandy... but then I realized she has more skills than Brandy and more tonality! SHE HAS A GREAT VOICE... I would study her music.</comment>

    <comment>This game was pretty cool to start out playing, but then you saw all the things that should have been improved. The lighting was off, the falling could have been improved, the soundtrack was so-so, etc. I don't recommend this game as something that needs to be in your game collection, there are better ones to come.</comment>

    <comment>I have loved this cd from the moment i got it! I think it's sometimes hard to find christian music that you like but here is a cd that I'm sure may people will love. It had a couple of very addicting songs, including-Be My Escape, which is probably my personal favorite. I think it's great that Relient K can easily pull of fun, christian music.</comment>

    <comment>I absolutely love this cd. I can't even fathom how many times I listened to this cd. It is amazing and just a wonderful cd. Definately worth your money!! The songs have such GREAT messages and a great sound to the too. Natalie Grant has an amazing voice and her and her producers have done an amazing job at putting together this cd. Plus, for any Wynonna fans out there, Wynonna sings on this track, and she brings a great new flavor to the song. Hope you buy it!</comment>

    <title>Great TV Show finally on DVD</title>
    <comment>This show was amazing when it was first on, and after not being able to see it for a long time, it is still just as amazing. This DVD was worth the long wait. I hope everyone will get it and share it with all of their friends. Cagney and Lacey was a series that was ahead of its time. The issues that are dealt with were very controversial at its time. This show was great for the way women are perceived in TV, and how women can be strong and independent.</comment>

    <title>Best Thing To Happen To DVD's</title>
    <comment>I have purchased M*A*S*H Martinis and Medicine Collection from Best Buy, and I must say it is the best purchase I have ever bought. I grew up watching MASH and it is my all-time favorite show. All of the seasons are in this collection,including the very last 2 1/2 hour show,also the original 1970 movie,also included in the collection are two discs full of special features and a trivia game. Features even include bloopers from the shows. I would recomend this collection to every MASH fan,(even to those who are not). It also comes in a great boxed case with a collectors book. I think everyone should own this collection from Best Buy.</comment>

    <comment>Another great season of Scrubs. This is one of the funniest shows that has ever been on TV. I think season five was definitely one of the best seasons.</comment>

    <title>Super Great Movie</title>
    <comment>This movie really brings out what it means to be in a life or death situation. The roles played by Kevin Costner and Ashton Krucher are excellent. They bring the characters to life in way that no one else could. The training that Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers get can only be vital in a life saving situation, and this movie brings that to the screen. It also shows what being part of a team is, and what it means when one of the team is lost. I highly recommend this movie for everyone.</comment>

    <title>DLINK makes the best networking equipment</title>
    <comment>This is an excellent router. Great range and speed. I can get signal on my laptop from my router downstairs and a room over. The speed never falters, and I haven't had any problems. This router replaced my Belkin wireless N router, which only allowed downloads speeds of about 10 kbps, with my 6mb cable internet. only had about 1 or bars of strength, while this DLINK always has about 4 or 5 bars of signal strength.</comment>

    <title>great little machine at a great price.</title>
    <comment>i bought this because i do a lot of faxing &amp; copying but did not want to invest a lot of money in a fax machine. this little unit was just what i needed and it's already paid for itself, even with the PSP (insurance)- no more pricy trips to kinko's. easy to set up and use even for the technically challenged like myself. compact size saves workspace, copy jobs are a bit slow but fine quality. overall a great little machine for the price.</comment>

    <title>One of the best!!</title>
    <comment>Halo 2 is by far the best online first person shoter (FPS) game avaliable. Anyone with an Xbox must have this game. The campaign was not quite as good as Halo 1, but it is still great, not to mention you need it for Halo 3. For an Xbox 1 game it looks great, one of the better looking games for last gen systems.</comment>

    <title>Refreshing Werewolf Movie</title>
    <comment>At first I didn't give this movie much hope of being anything more then another retreaded werewolf tale. I took a chance and watched it and I hace to say it turned out to be right up there as one of the best werewolf movies out there. It is a new and refreshing take on the werewolf. Instead of it just being the same old blood thirsty beast tearing through a town with out rhyme or reason, this werewolf has a personality. Take the best parts of both Freddy and Jason wrap that up in a werewolf and you have the Big Bad Wolf. The acting was very good in the movie especially Richard Tyson. Don't just take my word for it see for yourself you might just be suprised.</comment>

    <title>Best John Travolta</title>
    <comment>If you ever liked having stories read to you when you were young, then you will love this movie. Sit back and let the story be told to you, make sure you have tissues near by. Possibly the best performances by Travolta and Scarlett Johansson. Both played very different roles than we are used to seeing. I can not tell you much about it without spoiling the movie but i can say the soundtrack really made the movie make more sense. It gave a real southern Louisiana feel, like you were there. Maybe its cause it took place there. If you like slow but steady pace to your movies then get this movie. Just be prepared to see Travolta in a whole new role.</comment>

    <comment>FINALY!!! something someone with a Xbox can use! It was grate that they could come up with something and it kills 2 birds with one stone. Now that you no longer have to hunt and peck with the controler for what you want to write and 2. you also get a mike which is not bad for the price. It may not be wireless, but for those on a fixed budget and can not afford the Xbox 360 with all the bells and whisles, its a good thing to have.</comment>

    <title>Like a Carnival</title>
    <comment>While most fans cite "In the Aeroplane over the sea" as their favorite, I happen to like this one a lot. While "Aeroplane" is completely gorgeous, and makes you wish you could play an instrument or write a song just as beautifully-- this album would make you want to give it a try. Recorded at home by Robert Schneider of the Apples in Stereo, this personal offering takes it's place alongside the 4-track masterpieces of it's time, like "Bee Thousand" by Guided by Voices. While all the songs are quote potent, and dense, these songs are especially magical and showcase Jeff Mangum's brilliant writing: Song Against S?x (this word is considered profane for some reason, there's nothing wrong with submitting the song name in my review!) , Someone is waiting, Leave me Alone, Naomi. Jeff is also quite adept with sound collage, as evidenced by Marching Theme, which sounds like it contains: a 3 piece drum kit with jingle bells, a huge guitar with one string, the arpeggiating keyboard from "Baby you're a rich man", and Zamfir, the ascended master of the pan flute. It really works! You'll notice that there are some "sister" songs here, songs that are connected by a common theme, but that is not much of a surprise when you realize that Jeff writes dozens of songs around a theme and picks the best parts of them to assemble one song. 'A Baby for Pree' and 'Where you'll find me now' are such songs, connected by a common chord progression, but they are very different in content. His writing is cerebral and visual, going everywhere and creating lucid, fantastic realms, making the ordinary pleasurable, and the tragic absolutely heart-rending. Give it a listen and they'll probably be your new favorite band.</comment>

    <title>the most underrated &amp; overlooked album of all time</title>
    <comment>you've heard the name. you've heard the voice. you probably never heard this cd or even knew it existed but you have definitely missed something amazing. many thanks to whomever thought to re-release this album as it deserves a second chance. most of us probably remember linda when she fronted the defunct band 4 non blondes in the early nineties. after parting ways, she hooked up with producer bill bottrell to produce this masterpiece which was released in the latter 1996 on the interscope label. sadly, very few people knew of the release &amp;eventually the album went out of print. linda perry was forced to go independent. doesn't this just kill you? if there was ever any question as to how talented or innovative ms. perry was, this album is a great reference point. forget the albums that she produces for everyone else. this was the real mccoy. in flight is a grand example of the energetic world ms. perry encompasses with grace. hear it for yourself before it goes out of print again.</comment>

    <title>perhaps the best album of 2005</title>
    <comment>wherever i traveled towards the end of 2005 &amp; the beginning of 2006, devendra was definitely with me. everyone around me was subjected to his musical charm whether they liked it or not. cripple crow was just that good. it was quite simply the best folk album we never heard in the late sixties or seventies. devendra is quite simply too young to have grown beside this genre of music but yet he possesses the ability to create that homegrown sound. whether he is rambling incessantly about the idiosyncratic &amp; the quirky or simply giving his honest views about war in general, devendra manages to hold the listener's attention through 20 some od tracks. i could easily see fans of the beatles, cat stevens, &amp; woody guthrie flocking to the store on this note. hey, even bob dylan or santana fans would probably dig a great deal of the material here. no disappointments to speak of.</comment>

    <comment>This CD is a wonderful mix of R&amp;B and Soul music. Tracks such as "Butterflyz" and "Caged Bird," offers the listener an experience that cannot be compared to the music of any other artist. Alicia Keys' mix of urban and classical music on this CD gives the listener a peak into the life of the little girl who overcame life's obstacles by immersing herself in classical music. This CD is a testament to the fact that she is definitely a force to be reckoned with.</comment>

    <title>Good investment</title>
    <comment>We have rental properties and this steam cleaner is a life saver. It is heavy to lift but easy to move around the room. It does not have it's own heat source for the water but if you put the water in hot... it seems to work great.</comment>

    <title>nacho cerda's first three short films</title>
    <comment>anyone who loved the abandoned this past year might be interested to see three short films that nacho cerda made in the early nineties. be warned: aftermath does contain some very brutal violence &amp; may be considered disturbing to some viewers. this short film involves a demented man who performs an autopsy on a recently deceased young woman. then he proceeds to take liberties with the corpse which is certainly the most repulsive aspect of the dvd. if you can get past the brutality of this short film, the other two are actually quite beautiful &amp; almost somber at time. awakening deal with a young high school student who falls asleep during class &amp; awakes to find the entire classroom frozen in time. this short film is shot in black &amp; white. although not graphic at all, this particluar short walks the fine line between beautiful &amp; disturbing. the last short is perhaps my favorite entitled genesis. a grieving man siply can't get the past the recent passingof his beloved wife so he begins to make a statue which will ultimately resemble her. as the statue is almost completed, we find our sculpture turning to stone &amp; the statue is given life through the scultpure's sorrow. definitely a must have for any serious film collector &amp; this dvd is a bargain.</comment>

    <title>Great Portable Radio</title>
    <comment>Overall this product is fantastic. I recently purhcased this product, to use when doing yardwork. Don't want to risk damaging an ipod while working in the yard. For the money, this AM/FM radio is the best thing you can fidI was concerned about the volume control and that has been great. I have used it when jogging as well. the radio always gets a great signal. Unfortunately it has fallen few times, but the product is very resilient and hasn't skipped a beat. The radio also allows for 10 preset AM and FM station which is more than enough.</comment>

    <title>Funniest Show Ever</title>
    <comment>This T.V. show is unbelievable, by far the funniest and wittiest writing I've ever seen in a show. Ron Howard is a genius, his writing style is far better than any other I've seen, and the actors pull off comedy with an unbeatable style. Better than The Office, this show will leave you laughing fit to burst</comment>

    <title>Eh...</title>
    <comment>I love tearjerkers. This movie on the other hand while cute with a good story wasn't it. It's a good wholesome movie to sit down with your kids and watch to teach them something. Though I'm not sure that they'd sit through it. It's pretty lull and not to eventful and I believe it's one of those movies for a rainy day. Not bad, could have been better.</comment>

    <title>ingmar bergman's latest film</title>
    <comment>i'll have to admit that i've never seen scenes from a marriage so i wouldn't be qualified to compare the two films unfortunately. i think i was a bit too young to have seen any of bergman's other films in the theatres &amp; had thought for many years that he retired after making fanny &amp; alexander. to my surprise, he gave his latest masterpiece a couple of years ago &amp; it's yet another jewel in his crown. bergman has always had an ear for excellent dialogue &amp; saraband is no exception to the rule. what i found perhaps most fascinating other than the obvious two leads who are phenomenal was the performance of karin played by the young julia dufvenius. where on earth did ingmar find her? this, by far, is one of the most amazing performances i've ever seen? why didn't she receive the oscar is beyond me. oh well, foreign film fans everywhere can rejoice &amp; only pray that ingmar will bless us again with more films before he retires from the film industry again.</comment>

    <title>The Excellence of Execution!!!!!!</title>
    <comment>"The Hitman" Bret Hart is one of the greatest performers of all time, alongside Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair as the top three. As you will see in this AWESOME 3 DVD set, Bret Hart stood for everything that is (or was) right about the wrestling business. Bret never did anything demeaning, as he always done whatever was asked of him. I will review the matches, but as it relates to the story on Disc 1, it is tremendous. Bret (and others) get to tell their side of the story, and it's very easy to relate to Bret as he tells his side. As far as the matches go, here's my review: Hart Foundation vs. British Bulldogs (Madison Square Garden, 07/13/85) ***1/2 (Awesome chemistry when these two teams face each other.) Hart Foundation vs. Killer Bees (Madison Square Garden, 02/17/86) ***1/2 (Another very good tag team match on this DVD.) Bret Hart vs. Ricky Streamboat (Boston Garden, 03/08/86) ****1/2 (Most people might not have seen this match, but with these two legendary performers, they didn't disappoint.) Bret Hart vs. Ted DiBiase (Odessa, TX, 03/08/89)**** (Again, another match that most people might not have seen. An excellent match between these two, even if the commentary is semi-non existant.) Hart Foundation vs. Rockers (Saturday Night's Main Event, 04/28/90)*** (Wow, this match could've been a CLASSIC if given more time.) WWE Tag Team Championship Match Hart Foundation vs. Nasty Boys (Wrestlemania VII, 03/24/91)***1/2 (Bret and the Anvil lost the tag titles in this match, setting up the long awaited Bret singles push.) WWE Intercontinental Match Bret Hart vs. Mr. Perfect (SummerSlam, 08/26/91)****1/4 (The CLASSIC match where Bret finally wins his first singles title.) WWE Intercontinental Match Bret Hart vs. British Bulldog (SummerSlam, 08/29/92)***** (Arguably Bret's best match ever. Required viewing for this one.) Bret Hart vs. Bam Bam Bigelow (Barcelona, Spain, 04/24/93)*** Good match, but hard to view, figuratively, since it is with Spanish commentary.) King of the Ring Semi-Final Match Bret Hart vs. Mr. Perfect (King of the Ring, 06/13/93)****1/4 (Another classic match between these two.) Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart (Wrestlemania X, 03/20/94)***** (The first match in the classic rivalry between these two brothers. More required viewing.) WWE Championship Match Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart (White Plains, NY, 09/29/94)****-***** (I'm debating the rating for this one, but it is another awesome match and the final one between the brothers.) Bret Hart vs Hakushi (In Your House, 05/14/95)***1/2 (A very good match for these two @ the first In Your House PPV.) WWE Championship Match Bret Hart vs. Diesel (Survivor Series, 11/19/95) ****1/4 (The table spot makes it debut in this match, as Bret regains the title for the third time, also giving Diesel his second best match ever.) WWE Championship Match Bret Hart vs. British Bulldog (In Your House, 12/17/95)**** (Not better than their Summerslam 92 match, but still an excellent match nonetheless.) Submission Match Bret Hart vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (Wrestlemania 13, 03/23/97)***** (One of my favorite matches of all time, more required viewing.) WWE Championship Match Bret Hart vs. Undertaker (One Night Only, 09/20/97)****1/2 (Another match where most people might not have seen it, An awesome match that is one of the Undertaker's best.) Owen Hart Tribute Match Bret Hart vs. Chris Benoit (WCW Nitro, 10/04/99)***** (Bret and Benoit had a CLASSIC match in the wreckage known @ the time as WCW. The LAST true great match in that company's history.) Easter Eggs Easter Egg: Stampede Wrestling interview How to Access: On Disc One, Go to Chapters. Highlight Stampede Wrestling'. Click the left arrow twice and the clip will play. Easter Egg: Bret Hart discusses believability inside the ring How to Access: On Disc Two, Go to Chapters, Highlight 'Bret Hart vs. Ricky Steamboat'.

If Bret didn't directly go to the WWE and have his input, it wouldn't have been this way. And all of the matches on here are personally selected by Bret. So, even if he did leave out some of his other classics, I still have no arguments. Strongly recommended.</comment>

    <title>don't you just hate the critics?</title>
    <comment>on the opening week of this release in theatres, the critics nearly massacred the work much to my disbelief. thank goodness this brilliant work of genius terry gilliam &amp; hunter thompson has managed to have an incredible shelf life in the video media world. criterion has even gone so far as to release an incredible set for serious fans of the film to re-experience. needless to say, it looks fantastic &amp; is definitely a great investment. this is, by far, johnny depp's most bizarre yet versatile role &amp; everything else could almost pale in comparison. you won't even remember edward scissorhands or the tv show 21 jump street after watching this. fear &amp; loathing excels in being disturbing, frightening, &amp; hilarious all at once. one is never certain whether they should be panicky or trembling with laughter. do yourself a favor &amp; grab a copy today!! why wait???</comment>

    <title>Great film</title>
    <comment>First of all, this movie is not for children. There is plenty of gore and violence. However, if you have the stomach for blood and dismemberment, you will find this to be an interesting fairy tale set in Spain around WWII. My biggest complaint was that the movie was promoted as fantasy, but the balance ends up being about 2/3 Spain and 1/3 fantasy world. Also the audio is all in Spanish, but the English subtitles don't really get in the way of enjoying this artistic and moving film.</comment>

    <comment>I really don't think this movie got the credit it deserved. I really was impressed by the relentlessness of this movie, it never stopped for one second. I particularly enjoyed it because it never paused for some casual humor like most horror movies do these days. It was brutal and unapologetic from start to finish.</comment>

    <comment>This album is great for anyone who is into music by Ne-Yo, Trey Songz, J. Holiday, and the like. The album is filled with a variety of tracks--some uptempo, some slower, but all with a great sound. Recommended for people who are into R&amp;B.</comment>

    <comment>I thought the mini games would last longer and that there might be more. The board game is sooooo slow. Don't get me wrong, it is a fun game, especially for kids but it was a disappointing purchase. I wish I would have rented it before I dropped full price on it.</comment>

    <comment>This is a different record for 50. It's more joints that you can dance and party to. It still has heat with "I Still Kill" etc. The only thing I don't like is the overall focus of the album. There isn't a theme or flow from track to track. It's like he just threw all good stuff in a pot...but just because you have fine ingredients...it doesn't mean they flow well together. The songs I could live without hearing is Amusement Park and Straight to the Bank.</comment>

    <title>Rainbow Six: Vegas Xbox 360</title>
    <comment>I'm a long time veteran of Tom Clancy's games and this is by far the best game he has out in all of his series. There is an immersive single player, co-op, and online multiplayer. The gameplay is quick, smooth and fun. The AI is the smartest that I've seen in a video game. This game is highly recommended to all first person shooter fans and even casual gamers.</comment>

    <title>College Dropout&gt; Late Registration &gt; Graduation</title>
    <comment>As a fan of Kanye, I was very disappointed. In his previous two albums he had a lot of depth from Roses to Through The Wire. On this album, he is rapping but not saying anything. A whole lot of HYPE for a whole lot of NOTHING. The hottest tracks are Good Morning (The Intro), Stronger, Can't Tell Me Nothing. The rest of the album is full of fillers. On "I Wonder" he raps like Lil Darrell. The rest have the same formula-&gt; sample rockers, light beat, weak lyrics. The worst tracks on the album include Barry Bonds, Good Life, Everything I am, Big Brother (in which he praises Jay Z although Dame gave him a shot at stardom), The Glory. I keep listening to the album hoping the songs wil grow on me, but nope. I love the melody to Drunk and Hot Girls, but if the subject was different...it could have been hot. Save your money... unless it goes down to 5 bucks</comment>

    <title>Cant wait for Season 3 now!!</title>
    <comment>All the un-edited action for the true fans + the original Japanese score. I also has the American music *sort of, its NOT like it used to be on tv. Not nearly as awesome. Really looking forward to the next season though.</comment>

    <title>Great Great Show</title>
    <comment>One of the funniest shows on television, hands down. These guys know no boundaries and hold nothing back in these first two seasons, with the results being nothing short of hilarious. A must-have.</comment>

    <title>Still Can't Get 2 of the 1Gbs to Function</title>
    <comment>Just one of the PC2-5300, 1Gb modules works fine in my Toshiba, Satallite, M115-S1061, PC2-4200. But, when I install both of the 1Gb modules ( max. 2Gb ) into the slots, I get an error message and the notebook will not boot up. Also, I can install just 1 module and leave the 512 Mb, PC2-4200 module in its slot ( 1.5 Gb RAM ) and the system boots up fine and dandy. So, no one can tell me why both 1Gb modules will not work.</comment>

    <title>Quite a few hits</title>
    <comment>Quite a few hits &amp; solid songs on this one. Well worth picking up especially with the companion DVD. Comparisons to Iggy Pop "Lust for Life" are fair -- but you'll have to find the pulled track elsewhere.</comment>

    <comment>Very rarely do I ever come across a CD that I can play without skipping songs and listen all the way through. "A Beautiful Lie" is one of those albums. Probably one of the best CD's I've ever heard from a band! A+++</comment>

    <title>My first DSLR</title>
    <comment>I have owned 3 Nikon SLR cameras beginning with the F2-AS (the one that NASA sent to the moon). I also own a Cannon SLR, the Nikon - Coolpix 6.0MP and 2 Sony digital cameras (1.3 &amp; 4.0 MP). So, I decided to give Nikon a try with this digital camera mostly for the 10.2 MP capacity. I also bought the Nikon - Speedlight Flash SB-600, the Kodak EASYSHARE 5100 All-In-One Photo Printer, and a PNY 4GB Secure Digital High Capacity Memory Card. I have been taking pictures for 23 years all over the world. Weight is key when traveling, and not having to carry film is a plus. Also, the ability ti preview your pictures right away and not having to wait to develop them is also a nice feature. After testing a number of automatic and manual features with--without the SB-600 flash--and printing the pictures in 5X7 - 8X10, I highly recommend this package. Film is out.</comment>

    <title>Its Aiiight</title>
    <comment>Im a old school hip-hop fan and what most of todays rappers rap about have been done so many times previously that it comes out as recycled garbage. That being said what artist such as Kanye West bring to the table is refreshing as a music fan not just as a rap or hip hop fan. Curtis is ok as far as rap albums are concerned, there is a reason behind rappers having to rely on callabo songs. If fitty sings anymore hooks he may have to change his genre to r&amp;b singer. As far as King of New York, cmon, we all know that belongs to Jay-z even tho he's supposedly retired, and before him it was Biggy. From the last few hip cd's i have bought, Common, Talib Kweli and Kanye, i would have to put 50 at bottom of that list</comment>

    <title>Best Cd This Year</title>
    <comment>I agree with the other poster as far as quality of music from Kanye, Common, Talib Kweli. All excellant albums for the true hip hop fans. Kanye continues to be one of the few artists whose albums I purchase due to the fact he raises his level of creativity and quality of music to a new lvl everytime. As far as 50 is concerned, he has new beats and new cameos but its the same ol topics and in some cases lyrics in his previous albums. . Only complaint about Kanye is the Drunken Girls song, huge fan of Mos Def and song was disappointing.</comment>

    <title>Messenger bag style makes it worthwhile!</title>
    <comment>I have had camera bags before, all of which were cubes that included a handle to carry the bag as well as a shoulder strap. However, these bags were always a problem for me when hiking or travelling long distances. This SlingShot bag solved the problem with a messenger bag style across-the-shoulder strap. If you release the securing strap, the bag can swing to your side for quick access to your camera. It is comfortable to carry and has plenty of room for a SLR camera, lenses, and accessories. Although not ideal for carrying some of the larger lenses, it is a fantastic bag for the average/beginning user.</comment>

    <comment>Just upgraded from a whole set of 5300e logitechs and i can tell you there is almost a complete difference in quality the speakers themselves have problems with my xbox 360 controller i have hooked up to my computer but other than that a great product quality wise i just wise that they weren't usb so that my sound card wouldn't go to waste. 4 stars because its usb and that creates lots of conflicts with other usb electronics.</comment>

    <title>A Great Series</title>
    <comment>I would recommend this series on many levels. I find it very interesting it keeps me wanted more even though some of the characters are a bit on the annoying side but the main character I absolutely love and this allows me to keep watching over and over. It is very interesting how I can take the side of the serial killer over right versus wrong. The writers know how to add all aspects of humer, suspence, mystery and so much more. I also enjoy how the main character Dexter fights between "right and wrong" within himself in regards to his own killings. It's a must see.</comment>

    <title>50 is horrible</title>
    <comment>Guys...Come on 50 says the same thing but in a different way on every album. I think Em and Dr. Dre wrote his first CD for him then he took all the lyrics and has created two more CD's about the same thing. I used to be a huge 50 fan but i just cant say that i am anymore because all the garbage he puts out nowadays. So there is no way that you can say that this album is good(he's got Justin Timberlake and Robin Thicke on it). Actually i couldnt wait for the Kanye to come out and that has even dissapointed me b/c of the lack of tracks on the CD. Don't get me wrong the Kanye CD is awesome. If people say that 50 is better than Kanye, they just dont understand the intelligent lyrics that Kanye puts in his music compared to 50's first grade education lyrics. So stay true to yourself about Hip Hop and how its supposed to really be! Buy Kanye!</comment>

    <title>Great Music</title>
    <comment>Kanye Latest Debut album, Graduation, will go down as a hip hop classic, on a classic day for Hip Hop. Its so refreshing to hear music for the soul, not just rap all the time. Kanye brings music straight from his soul that acts, "like a dart from the speaker to your heart, Spiritually through the portal now his words are immortal!" That's a quote from Jay-z which describe what happens when you listen to Graduation!!</comment>

    <comment>I liked this game alot. It is pretty kool even when you do a side by side comparison to something like Oblivion. I like the no load screen part of the game and so far I have seen some really kool weapons and armour. the combining weapons and armour feature is nice and makes some very powerful items.</comment>

    <comment>This 2GB card is an excellent buy. Plenty of space for all of your standard needs. I have 5 hours of music stored on the card that I play daily on my GPS unit. I've never had a problem with the card and would definitely purchase another one when I run out of disk space.</comment>

    <comment>Call of Duty 2 is one of the best games I have ever played for the XBox 360. Once I started playing I couldn't put it down. The graphics were amazing and the game play was easy to learn and master. I can't wait to play the other Call of Duty games.</comment>

    <title>Best Movie Ever!</title>
    <comment>Title says it all. Like it! Timeless movie, there was another before it, but I haven't seen it. I like this one. Better than the book (which is rare). About a man...who, after fighting a war, decides to figure out life, and its purpose. This takes the form of a mostly spiritual and intellectual adventure with plenty of humor to boot. I wouldn't EXACTLY call it a drama until around half to three fourths of the way through the film. There is one character in particular called "Uncle Elliot" who is a riot because of his raucus, dry humor. He isn't a major character, but instead more of a "majorly minor" one. His role is still somewhat vital to the film though. It is also Bill Murray's best movie to date, yes, even better than "Groundhog Day". I give this movie 10 blargs out of 10.</comment>

    <comment>If you like Tom at all you will like him in this movie. I think it brings out the cop in him. I don't know how many there is going to be in this set of four so far. But I am looking to see another one soon I hope. I love to watch any thing with him in it. He is a really good actor.</comment>

    <title>simple &amp; clean</title>
    <comment>After recently getting a 5.1 surround sound theatre system, I was looking for a way to set everything up without having speaker wires running across the floor of our living room. Other than trying to avoid the bad appearance of having wires running across the floor, we were also trying to avoid damage, from people walking on them, tripping over them and having them chewed up by our dog. After finding this Rocketfish wireless speaker kit in the store, I bought it and gave it a shot. It was extremely easy to setup and the sound quality is incredible. I haven't experienced any hum coming from the speakers at all. One thing I love about this is the independent volume dial on the amplified receiver for the rear speakers. It allows easy adjustments to the back speaker volume that can be complicated on some soundsystems. If the price tag is holding you back, just know that for the ease and quality of this system is far better than trying to run wires under an area rug or under all of the baseboards of your room. This sounds great and keeps your room looking nice without any trouble.</comment>

    <title>Good system</title>
    <comment>We needed a system that could be spread out over a large 3 story house. The farthest point from the base doesn't work as well as the other stations, but it has proven to be a good solution for us.</comment>

    <title>Strictly For The Fans</title>
    <comment>This started out a good idea: take a great album, make music videos for (almost) ever song, and turn it into a DVD album. While you watch the anthology, you start to wonder if it would have been a better idea to take the time, effort and money put into this DVD, and applied that towards better quality videos. Still, if you enjoyed B'Day the album, you will mostly likely appreciate this DVD.</comment>

    <title>Typically, I do not buy music that I have heard...</title>
    <comment>Typically, I do not buy music that I have heard on the radio because it tends to have a short shelf life and I just lose interest in it quickly. This album has proven to be the exception. I have recommended it to all my friends. There's just something about it. You can hear the Scottish influence in KT's music through the rhythm and in some of the lyrics.</comment>

    <title>Charming, but quickly repetative</title>
    <comment>I borrowed this game from a friend and played it for an evening. While I found the cooking mini-games to be fun and engaging, I was burnt out after a couple of hours. The recipes all started to run together after a while as it started feeling like I was doing the same thing over and over again. This would be good for a weekend rental, but I would not recommend purchasing it.</comment>

    <title>Few words for bad artists</title>
    <comment>The so called new age music artists seem to get worse and worse as the years come along. Thus leading me to this horrible, dare i say artists, cd release. 50 Cent is like a candle that was never lit. None of his lyrics appeal to what someone will do in the real world and really needs to have a reality check. I must say this is not real Hip-Hop or Rap, this is garbage...</comment>

    <comment>This is a great accessory for your Xbox 360 Elite, Black Wireless controller. It turns your controller into a wired controller while it charges the rechargeable battery that comes with it. If you have the Microsoft Xbox 360 Play &amp; Charge Kit, you never need to find battery's for your wireless controller again; you're always ready to play!</comment>

It's fun to play by your self, or buy a second controller and battle it out with your friends. Anyone that has PS should get this game, and the following games as well.</comment>

    <title>Superlative Movie - Not For Everyone</title>
    <comment>This is a mind-blowing movie that is superbly directed and incredibly acted -- and yet, when you say, "It's a movie about pedophilia," a lot of people will move away. How wrong they are. This movie does not condone pedophilia, and portrays the victims of it in a real, direct, sincere way. Two kids have shared the horror of being molested, and they grew up in very different way: one is a soulless individual, the other one is someone who needs answers. Gregg Araki is on top of his game, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is mesmerizing. A sublime movie, too good to be ignored.</comment>

    <comment>How can you resist buying this terrific Elvis movie? In my opinion, its one of his best films and the fact thats its been remastered and repackaged is a treat. I even bought it at a fair price on buy.com as well. I dont believe Elvis was given enough credit for his acting abilities and this was one of the films in which they are showcased. Enjoy!</comment>

    <title>Mel's Greatness</title>
    <comment>The Mel Brooks Collection is a great showing of Mel's talent and humor. With a wide variety of movies ranging from Robin Hood to the wild wild west there is clearly no limit that Mel wont go. I highly suggest buy it right away.</comment>

    <title>This was an excellent deal</title>
    <comment>This show is the greatest, most hilarious show on NBC, and now on DVD! The first season in my opinion is the best. The price on here too! Trust me you will not be disappointed with the show and its price.</comment>

    <title>Most reliable media out there</title>
    <comment>After disappointing results with both off brand (such as store brand) and other major brand media, Verbatim is one of only two or three brands of DVD blank media I will buy. I have always had consistently excellent results whether burning a data-only disc for computer use or video for playback on my Sony DVD player. Other brands either burn poorly for DVD playback or degrade over time. Verbatim only sells discs made by one of the top quality manufacturers of blank media.</comment>

    <title>Good product time after time after time</title>
    <comment>I've used at least 500 Memorex DVD-Rs, so far no coasters that were caused by Memorex. I've used other brands and also had good luck but these are usually at a better price than other major brands. The design has changed several times that I have seen but there is always room to label the disc and with the print being a gloss vs matte finish you can write over the top of it; if you need to. As a DVD-R there can be compatibility isues with some players etc but I have tried these on at least a dozen DVD players at friends and families houses. They also work fine in my X-Box PS2 and a DVD-ROM drive in an older PC.</comment>

    <title>An Amazing Show!</title>
    <comment>This show was one of the funniest I have ever seen. I still count Seinfeld and MASH as my favortes but this is probably going to be right behind them. I am amazed at how well, how clever, this show was written. The first season of course has all the set up for the series, but also has that fresh feel of complete originality. I have never in my life seen a show like this, and I doubt I ever will. It is a complete shame most people never watched it. They really missed out. I really wish the show lasted more than three seasons. But maybe that adds to its appeal after all this time. This show really leaves you wanting more.</comment>

    <title>My Favorite show!!!!!!</title>
    <comment>I have loved this show since the first episode. So I have been totally hooked for 2 years now. I am in my late 30's, and I HATE horror movies with a passion. Please don't be scared off by the fact that there are scary things in the show. It is kind of soft-core horror. It is mostly a show about family, but with some awesome action scenes. (oh and the brothers are not too hard to look at either) I grew up on shows like Simon and Simon and Magnum PI. I have not had a good actiony show to love for so long now. I can't recommend this show enough. I only wish I could give it more than 5 stars. I'd give it 10 out of 5 stars if this darn site would let me!!!! Buy the first season as well and spend a whole weekend on your couch.</comment>

    <title>It Will NEVER Get Old</title>
    <comment>This is an amazing offer. Graphics aren't too good but you will be easily entertained. Choose from many classes and level up your character. You are able to download a "Hero Editor" and create your own items and hack your characters level. Unfortunately, internet play is very fun with friends and private groups but if you join a average game it will only be fun if you have a hacked character because many other characters are also hacked.</comment>

    <title>Good, but not necessarily new.</title>
    <comment>Well, here goes. This album has been heard before. Not literally, of course, although Quietdrive did release a 3-song EP that contained some of the songs from here. That stated, it starts out with the song "Rise from the Ashes". This is one of the more memorable songs. A few songs pass by. They aren't anything special. Next is "Rush Together", another of my favorites. "Maybe Misery" and "I Lie Awake" are two similar songs that probably shouldn't be next to each other, because though Quietdrive is a good, mildly creative band, these songs really don't show their best. Next up is "The Season". I remember it best as the song before what is the best song of the album. It's not creative, since "Time After Song" is a cover, but it's still a great song. It's getting some well-deserved airplay on the radio now, actually. Then, comes the nu-ballad "Both Ways", a heart-on-sleeve love song. It's a great way to close out the album, because sappy songs aren't always good songs. Conclusion: This is a good album. Overall, I'd have to give it 3.5 stars, which rounds up to 4. It's good, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone that likes rock/alternative. It's not breaking any new ground. A good buy, though.</comment>

    <comment>I thought guitar hero was awesome, but Guitar Hero encore is even better!!! Way better songs that you can rock out to waaaaaay more. My husband is the one who usually plays, but since the new one came out I play just as much as him...I may not be as good but I'm def. getting there. If you loved the previous Guitar Hero you def. won't be disappointed!!!!</comment>

    <title>HORRIBLE DISKS FOR LIGHTSCRIBE</title>
    <comment>Bought these as they were the largest spindle that I could buy locally... Price wasnt bad and well Memorex isnt Exactly Generic or are they. I got home and Started to do up a couple disks. Lightscribe was great... First Cd off the top. Went to do another disk.. Had 5 total that I needed done. Second Cd.. Error.. Stalled.. Tried for quite a while.. Tried everything new drivers and everything. Nothing worked.. Grabbed the 3rd cd.. Same thing.. 4th cd Same thing... At this point I am Frustrated.. I am thinking my new Drive is shot.. Grabbed a Random cd from the middle of the stack.. Label burns no problem. So I set the bad cds to the side and tried the 5th one down.. No Good... Very Upset now... Grabbed another Random one from the middle... No problem... Another Random one from the middle No problem.. To get my 5 cds I went thru a total of Twenty of the 50 cds I purchased. 15 Cds were bad.. Contacted Memorex thinking I was going to have to send the Bad Cds back to them. I would have just sent the entire remaining spindle. 75% failure rate is pretty horrible.. Why waste my time any further. They say they will send me out a New 50 pack but wanted the Receipt... How many people honestly keep a receipt for $22.99 for CDs... I explain that I dont have the Receipt but would gladly send them the remaining spindle plus the bad ones at their cost. They Refused.. It was either Receipt or nothing... Finally they Offered that they would send me out replacements for the Defective ones so far only but If any more were bad It was my loss... They wanted me to go thru the Rest of the 30 cds and Try them all and call them back with the Total Quantity... No they did not want to wait the 2-3months that I would take me to Casually do this... They wanted it done today and call them back tomorrow... Completely Unacceptable... 25mins to burn a working lightscribe label, 10-15mins to design each label, decide, purchase and download all the music you can think of wanting. If the disk Errors out on the label print that takes about 10mins to find out on top of everything else... Thats about 6hrs of my time if all of the remaining Cds were bad... I took my losses and DEcided to just "Share My story" instead. If your just doing Data great. Lightscribe labels WATCH OUT. I am at a 75% failure rate... SAVE your receipt if you purchase these and want any sort of warranty on them. WE all have an Occasional Coaster but 25% of the spindle so Far come on.. I have since bought Verbatims and had no Issues so Far and I have done 5 more CDs... Granted they were just a copy of the Previous 5 that I did all 5 worked right off the top without any issues...

    <title>Another Great Set from the Decemberists</title>
    <comment>Colin Meloy has a tendency to write intelligent lyrics and this cd was no exception. Although it's a little darker than their previous releases, it's still full of quirky tales that'll have your imagination running. This was their first cd on a major label and you can hear it. They sound slightly more mainstream... but only slightly. If you don't mind songs that will make you think as well as feel, give these a listen.</comment>

She is loved, and has a poetic flow heard like never before. She has the passion and the message flowed throughout her Silent Scream, so don't you Walk Away without purchasing this album because I Promise you will never stop playing it.</comment>

    <title>Awesome product</title>
    <comment>I purchased this 5-port gigabit switch awhile ago and works beautifully. Very impressive build. The unit has a metallic case instead of plastic. And the unit has a passive cooling system which makes it very quiet compared to some other gigabit switches that have fans built into them. I have both the 5-port gigabit and the 8-port gigabit switches being used on my home network. No software needed, just plug and play and forget about it. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and any other person asking on which switch is worthy for their hard-earned money.</comment>

    <title>MUST HAVE!!!</title>
    <comment>This album was great to hear. I picked it up and listened to it right away and i have to say i love the way it introduces you to the album with a softer song but still has kanye written all over it. This is really refreshing to hear yet another great kanye album and it is great how he seems to get in his punch lines that he usually gets in with his outstanding raps and melodys. I would defenatly recommend getting this album because it is one to be heard by all fans of kanye. Its a MUST HAVE classic album to have for your collection.</comment>

    <title>Read the product specs</title>
    <comment>Before you write a review, know your facts. The product specs clearly state that this item is for use with the nuvi series and the street pilot 5XX series. Of course this will not work with a street pilot 3XX series. I found this product easy to use and very helpful. Todays slanted windshields and some state laws make the use of this item essential.</comment>

    <comment>Please read my review for the 5-port gigabit switch. Same thing applies to this 8-port gigabit switch. The product works flawlessly. Passive cooling system so it is quiet and cool to the touch (no overheating). FAST! LED indicators on the front. Nice small power supply (same with the 5-port version). I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</comment>

    <title>Dont get me wrong.</title>
    <comment>Alright 50 aint as good as he use to be. I think he put all his good songs on get rich or die tryin' so you would be hyped about the massacre. This album to me was straight trash. Dont get me wrong i was and still am a 50 fan but i tried to give him a chance on this album but theres no reason for taking chances. I remembered that he made get rich or die tryin' so i gave him a chance to wow me unlike his 2nd cd the massacre. There was a couple good songs on that cd and its the same with this one. There is a couple songs that are good but the rest of the album is just played out. I say that if your gonna get a 50 album and dont yet have any of them to go buy get rich or die tryin'. But if have that and have faith in this album, dont get your hopes up. If you wanna get an album that is really worth your hard earned money go get the kanye album, It has everthing everyone loves about kanye and more. Do yourself a favor and pick up the Kanye album.</comment>

    <title>GREAT ALBUM!!!</title>
    <comment>This is one of the greatest albums ive ever heard. This album has everything everyone loves about akon and he doesnt fail to deliver on this album. I would defenatly as a huge akon fan recommend this album. If you are just getting into akon go get his first album and this album and i garentee that you will not be disappointed in what you hear. I have listened to this album countless times and it never gets old. It has all the great songs you heard on the radio which you will also not get tired of any time in this lifetime. I would absolutely recommend this album to anyone who likes a unique style of rap, hip-hop, R&amp;B, and soul. Money very well spent that i will never regret spending in my life.</comment>

    <title>The one and only Godzilla</title>
    <comment>After fifty years, this movie is still the best Godzilla movie of all time. The classic black and white style stills brings out a sense of realism to any child seeing it for the first time or die hard fans of the king of all monsters. It is good that Best Buy has become the number one supplier of any Godzilla movie, past to present, and I hope they will have more in stores to come.</comment>

    <title>Premonition</title>
    <comment>I have enjoyed watching Sandra Bullock in every movie she has made, and Premonition is no exception. It was a great mystery, not at all confusing to me. As the story line continued and we learned more about what was really going on, I was hoping each time she woke up that her husband would be alive. Right down until the final minutes when she attempts to change the past and save him and we learn that it was actually her fault he died because she told him to turn around, I was rooting that the ending would turn out happy. After the crash is reshown for the last time, I just expected her to wake up one more time and see him in the bed. The story just proves that we cannot change the past. I believe her character had a true power to see the future, but she was at the mercy of something she could not change. I enjoyed the story and the acting and the surprise ending which actually brought some happiness to the final situation. I will be adding this to my DVD collection.</comment>

    <title>Oh my god - now what</title>
    <comment>This series even got my wife hooked and she hates Science Fiction. With every new eppisode the characters become more and more like good friends and puts you in there shoes. Minoritys have allways tryed to fit in, and to be just regular people trying just to survive. With this series you understand this and fill for the underdog. There is charming and funny things about the Aleins that make them so differant from us but does that make them evil? The TV only movies that follow the series continue the plot and story line of the series and and after each one you want more. This collection has the best and most creative caracters and story line of any Science Fiction around. Get the series--get the new TV movies on DVD which Best Buy has an exclusive on (Best Buy knows the good stuff) shake and scratch your head for every eppisode brings some really weird,wild,wacky and wonderful entertainment.</comment>

    <title>Decent antenna</title>
    <comment>I purchased one of these antennas about 4 years ago and I ended up not needing it so I gave it to a friend. She says it works just fine. I recently had to pick up another antenna to replace the one I gave away and I had no problem purchasing the same model by RCA. They aren't exactly the "LG" of brand names but the antenna does a decent job for only $14.99.</comment>

    <title>Different Styles</title>
    <comment>Don't listen to reviewers who tell you that because Kanye's album is good that 50 Cent's sucks or vice versa. That's all garbage people. Comparing Kanye and Fifty is like comparing apples and oranges - - their styles are completely different. I happen to be a fan of both, even if Kanye says some things in the media that turn me off to him, his music is still undeniably catchy. Kanye is great for being in a contemplative mood and 50 is great when you want a banger or a great dance song. In short, listen to both Curtis and Graduation and decide for yourself what you like and what you don't - and let's face it, for 10 bucks it's really hard to go wrong with this CD.</comment>

    <title>A great xbox 360 title</title>
    <comment>Single player boasts a realistic and exciting story line and leaves you craving more. Controls handle flawlessly. Nice graphics. The AI at times may be a little idiotic. A multitude of online gameplay options! Great selections of weaponry. Ability to input you face on your online character via box live vision camera. Customize gear and unlock new weapons. By far one of my favorite 360 games to date! Highly recommend!!</comment>

    <title>Disappointing movie</title>
    <comment>I had heard many people raving about this movie and with the outstanding cast I was anticipating a great film. Unfortunately, when the movie was over I felt very disappointed. The first 1.5hr or so was a bit slow but well done, characters were developed and a it headed toward a plot. Then the film took a "what the heck" turn that didn't pay off.</comment>

    <title>Supernatural WB/CW's new hit</title>
    <comment>I've remember first watching Supernatural after being a viewer of Smallville ever since it first started. I decided to watch Supernatural because the guy who in Smallville played Lana's boyfriend in Season 5 of Smallville is playing one of the lead roles in Supernatural. The show at the time being on The WB. Ever since I first saw it I fell in love with this show just like how I had falling in love with Smallville and used to watch Buffy The Vampire Slayer as well as Angel on WB. Supernatural like all these other shows has been able to keep me interested just as much as it's initial spark of interest of all these other shows. If you are a fan of Smallville, or any of the other mentiond WB shows or Charmed I would recommend Supernatural and have a feeling you will not be disappointed. My next goal is to get some family/relatives into Supernatural like I did with Smallville shortly after it first came out even thought I was watching it from the beginning. Supernatural just shows how good tv shows can be with these day and age were good tv shows seem to get canceled. I was sure excited when CW decided to continue on with Supernatural once CW was formed through the merge of the former The WB and UPN networks/channels.</comment>

    <title>Great show, decent dvd set</title>
    <comment>This is the best new show on TV as far as I'm concerned and the DVD set is pretty nice. There are a bunch of commentaries though unfortunately in most cases it's just one person doing the commenting. Next season I would prefer if they had 2 or 3 people per commentary, more interaction and discussion. The blooper reel is funny but I wish there were more deleted scenes. If I were to rate the DVD presentation I'd give it an A for picture, A+ for content, the actual shows, and a B for extras, they can do better in that regard.</comment>

    <title>Kanye has yet again raised the bar for</title>
    <comment>One of if not thee album of the year Kanye takes hiphop in to fresh new realms with songs like Stronger, Drunken Hot Girls and I Wonder... And classic Kanye songs like The Glory Good Morning, Champion, Good Life, and Can't Tell Me Nothing; Barry Bonds is a great song until you get to Lil Wayne which almost destroyed the song but with Ye charisma in style keeps the song flowing... And how can i forget Big Brother a salute to Jay- Z that leaves you wishing for a big brother as influential... Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion i wish her heart was still in rhymen...</comment>

    <comment>When first watching the movie it may not be as funny as others, but watch it a second time and you will be laughing histerically. It is a great movie to quote and you will be sure to get a few laughs. I have seen it at least 10 times and it seems funnier everytime. I would definately recommend it if you want a good laugh. It is in my top 10 comedies.</comment>

    <comment>This movie was better than I expected. Travolta plays a great role. Good family movie, though there may be a little bit of swearing.</comment>

    <title>Great</title>
    <comment>If you are a fan of musicals, than you already have this movie, but for those of you that aren't, this is still a great movie. Let go of the fact that its a musical, and enjoy Eddie Murphy's return, Jamie Foxx standing tall, Beyonce playing well Beyonce (not a big stretch), and Jennifer Hudson making a breakout performance. You will cry, laugh and give a standing ovation, even at home.</comment>

    <title>Same old</title>
    <comment>The non next gen version made no leaps this year. It took last years game and made some improvements. There are still some lingering bugs that they did not address, but for the most part it is a better game. If you dont have last years game then its a good buy. Otherwise you need to be a die hard fan, like me, to buy this newest madden.</comment>

    <title>Best Buy on Sept. 11th</title>
    <comment>Kanye West's new album entitled "Graduation" brings a new variety of sound and flavor. The music is refreshing and a new approach for Kanye. The album may not be his best work to date, but the album still has the strength to be the album of the year. A definite hip-hop instant classic with an album you can play straight through and listen to over and over. With songs like "Good Life" and "Cant Tell Me Nothin", this song already has singles slated to top the charts. Pick this CD up as soon as you can.</comment>

    <title>Best season ever</title>
    <comment>I am a huge fan of the show, and unlike most think that season 5 was the best one of them all. The box set was great and helped me recapture all the memories and experience of watching it the first time. And as with all the dvd box sets from Joss Whedon, the extras were great!</comment>

    <title>Big Hype, But Not Worth the Wait</title>
    <comment>Superman Returns just plain and simple sucks. The only thing that is good in this movie is Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther, and of course the ending. The chemisty between the two leading actors are non-existence, and you really don't care about anybody. To top everything off, Superman is a baby daddy...Are you serious. Sorry if I runnied the movie for anyone that hasn't seen it, but that's too crazy to have Superbaby Daddy</comment>

    <title>POWER!</title>
    <comment>Yes, when I bought my HP laptop (model dv9408nr) a couple of weeks ago, I also bought 1gb of extra memory (later had to but the second gig of memory when I found out there were 2 521mb instead of just one 1gb). Anyway, I am very please with this PNY product and highly recommend it. The instructions are easy to understand. Plus, if you buy it for full price like I did, and Best Buy lowers the price within 2 weeks, call them and they will give you a full credit for the difference in price!</comment>

    <title>BNL getting worse with age...</title>
    <comment>This may end up being the last BNL album I purchase, and I bought it 3 years ago. I can't decide if my music tastes are changing, or if BNL's musical style is changing. This CD only had about 3 or 4 good songs (Maybe Katie and Upside Down are the best) and no really outstanding songs. The music is still fun and the lyrics are entertaining as always, but I rarely find myself wanting to pop this CD in my car. I haven't heard much from their 2 newer albums, but this CD hasn't made me want to investigate further.</comment>

    <title>Great tv series</title>
    <comment>Prison Break season 2 is one of the best tv series ever. It keeps you in the edge of your seat the whole time. Having it on DVD is the best way to watch it, you dont have to wait a week to see what happens next. I watched all of season two and bought it on DVD so I can now rewatch it to get ready for the new season coming up. I recommend this for everyone, now that I have been watching them lately on DVD my sister is getting hooked, and she had never watched it before.</comment>

    <title>BEST GAME EVER!!!</title>
    <comment>I'm just getting back from a demo in San Fransico, CA and this game is cooler then what the hype is all about. you can record your missions and later take screen shots of all your best kills and send them to friends. if that wasnt enough the new weapons are AWESOME!!! you can also edit maps to your liking (weapons, vehicles, etc). share files on live and many more. i gotta go! need to get ready to head out for NY to set-up the next demo of Halo 3. hope this helps.</comment>

    <title>Good game</title>
    <comment>As with the rest of the Mario Party games, this one is fun with a group of people. It keeps the similar playing style that we are familiar with in the other Mario party games in which we go around trying to buy stars by winning coins in mini-games. The boards are set up like a board game where you roll the dice to see how many spaces you get to go. Since this is the first Wii Mario party game, the controls are different and you have more options than a normal analog controller. It's fun but I wished there were more maps and more unlockable items. The game is fun in a group setting but gets old really fast in one player mode. I would suggest this to anyone looking for a party game and owns 4 wii-motes.</comment>

    <title>The Turtles are Stronger than Ever</title>
    <comment>This movie is by far the Best Turtle movie of the four, the originals are classics, but this takes me back to the comic book and the first movie. The CGI work is awesome, as an animator myself, i was just blown away. The detail, the action, all just says TMNT. I would definately recommend this to a friend.</comment>

    <title>It's all about the fun</title>
    <comment>Another great Mario game from Nintendo. Simple to learn, and addictively fun to play! Its layout is similar to Super Mario 3 - each level has a map with "stops" you must complete in order to reach the castle. But this game also introduces its own twists - giant Mario, tiny Mario, etc. A great game for both adults and kids, with many hours of excellent gameplay. Even though I've won the game, I still enjoy re-playing it. I highly recommend it!</comment>

    <title>Solid game. EA keeps up improvements</title>
    <comment>While I do think games can become over complex over their development EA Sports has kept the improvements solid once again with NHL 08. I would highly suggest getting this game even more so if you are a fan of the NHL or EA Sports NHL. Graphics are solid on PS2 version as well. I am happy with my purchase and Best Buy Online purchase had me playing it on opening day. Thanks Best Buy.</comment>

    <title>One of the best series that Nick has put out</title>
    <comment>I have been watching Nickelodeon for a very long time and I have seen shows come and go. Even though Avatar: The Last Airbender is a fairly new show, it is one of Nick's best show they have ever put on their network. It has a great plot, comic relief and great animation. This is a must see you any anime, cartoon, or martial arts fan.</comment>

    <title>who needs the originals?</title>
    <comment>This collection is appropiately called the essentials due to its story twists charging the move from the mansion to new territories but also for its insight to what the average person went through in that nightmare. It may sound overarching the point BUT otherwise any new fans will miss a HUGE turning point in veronica x, miss an otherwise underachiving outbreak. case in point this games are awesome nitpicks from the well of resident evil before its perfection in part 4. which just begs a play if you haven't it! Try it if you are curious and you'll find a frustating game thats worth every second of slow controls just to find the next key.... Just kidding! I love the franchise and since my kids destroyed those games years ago they are worth another buy to fill in until part 5, then i'll be h*** (or heaven) who knows! Just go out and play and have fun!</comment>

    <title>Best Shane &amp; Shane yet</title>
    <comment>This is a CD full of praise for God! I'm excited about listening to it. Some Major Pluses: I love the inclusion of a cello in the background music and it is all soulful music. The instrumental track is awesome! I I've been a fan of Shane &amp; Shane for years and this is their best yet. It's all new music but with the same feeling and meaning behind each song that we've come to love as Shane &amp; Shane we love!</comment>

    <title>Great Series To Own.</title>
    <comment>I've been watching this show since it first aired on CW. It's really not what you would expect to be on that station. It's more of a show that should be on FX. The stories are great, some of them will even remind you of being a kid again, hearing about Blood Mary and being freeked out over Clownes or the Urban Legend of The Hook Man. The first season is great and the second does not disapoint. If you don't have the first season, or have watched it yet, pick that up along with this since it's only 19.99 and the second season is only 40.00. Trust me when i tell you, that you will not be disapointed with this purchase whatsoever.</comment>

    <comment>possibly one of Bowies best concerts. It is packed with a lot of energy and the stage set up are fantastic. The theatric's are truly well put together, from glass spider to bang bang to-china girl etc... I personaly think is was and is his best recorded concert. I would have liked to see 'panic in detroit" but you can't please everyone.</comment>

    <title>Perfect 10</title>
    <comment>Halo 2 is a great game for all those who enjoy intense multiplayer action. Even if you don't like multiplayer, the story mode will not allow you to put the controller down with its rich and in-depth storyline. Halo 2 has been a wonderful experience for ma and has recieved great acclaims throughout the gaming world.. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who owns an XBOX console.</comment>

    <comment>I am so happy that Showtime finally released the 2nd season of soul food. I am a true fan, I watched the first box set of season 1 so many times. My Husband is happy that they released the 2nd season! I am hoping that they will not take as long to release season 3.</comment>

    <title>Fun new songs but a rent</title>
    <comment>Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s only has 30 songs and no unlockable songs to purchase. The song list is ok like the other guitar hero games not every songs a homerun .I think its over priced 50 bucks for 30 songs is not a good deal at all.That being said some of the songs are great this is good for a guitar hero fan who wants to play new songs.</comment>

    <title>Not that good...</title>
    <comment>This was a waste of money to me honestly. This game doesn't seem to be complete, and if this is honestly how the developers wanted it to be then they are horrible and shouldn't continue making games. Multiplayer aspect of it could have been really fun, you can get really powerful way to fast and become gosu. It gets boring right after that happens. Single player isn't to bad but how the game runs pretty much ruins it for me. It's hard to even play it on multiplayer.</comment>

    <title>Best in the Series</title>
    <comment>By far, one of my favorite movies of all time. Aliens is one of a few sequels to live up to the original film and in this case surpass it! With a terrific cast including Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen this movie delivers in all aspects. The story is great, action is intense and the special effects are done tremendously well. If you're thinking about getting Aliens then this special edition is the way to go with both the theatrical cut and director's cut included. I highly recommend this dvd!</comment>

    <title>Good, but not their best.</title>
    <comment>Rilo Kiley is one of my favorite bands, but I'm out of the loop. I didn't hear about this album until the it's release date. Before then I thought the band had split off into solo projects, so I was excited to get my hands on this album. When I got it I was kind of surprised. The music wasn't completely different from their usual sound, but they added a dash of 70s funk, and the lyrics had repetitive chorus lines which were a little annoying in some tracks. I still wouldn't call this a bad album. Jenny Lewis' voice is still amazing, Blake Sennett's guitar is still mesmerizing, and you can still hear their sound under the newly adopted funk. True, I wouldn't say this is their best album, but it's still Rilo Kiley, which is always better than most things the music scene has to offer.</comment>

    <title>The Best Show on TV</title>
    <comment>I can't say enough good things about Supernatural. It's horror, thriller, it's drama, it's comedy all and it's family all rolled into one. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki really make this show work. Every week is a different adventure and you never know what emotion you will end up feeling. They truly provide an hour of enjoyable television every week. And each season continued to improve upon the next. Eric Kripke has provided us with a wonderful show and dares to go where most won't in order to tell the story he wants to tell. Check it out and you will be hooked.</comment>

    <title>Great Value</title>
    <comment>I bought this cord to connect my iPod to my car CD Deck. It works great. I can use it with the video iPod and the shuffle iPod. It's so much better then the transmitter I was using before. I don't think I need a 6' long cable. But there wasn't a 3' available when I was buying. I think it's a great value for the price, especially considering other cables were twice as much.</comment>

    <title>Can I order an illusion on the rocks with a twist?</title>
    <comment>My boyfriend is a fireman and he watched this movie at the firehouse. Well, when he got home thats all he could talk about. We went and bought the movie that night so I could watch it and we could talk about how great it was over dinner. I was just like him. I raved about it to everyone that I spoke to. Well, first of all Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors and of course Jessica Beil is hot as usual. It was a very good movie for Edward Norton. He is a mysterious actor as it is. You never hear much about him. So for this movie being kind of dark it fit him well. The plot will grab you and the ending will make you gasp. You definitly wont be able to just watch it once. So, thats why its best just to go ahead and purchase The Illusionist.</comment>

    <title>Fastest way to speed up Vista!!!</title>
    <comment>I got a Toshiba laptop on sale that only came with 512mb of ram. At first I got another 512 stick. Then these went on sale! I took it back to BB and they refunded it and I bought one of these 1gig sticks. The only thing was my laptop still much faster but I lost the dual channel aspect. So I finally just popped out the 512 that came with it and I got ANOTHER gig. I now have 2 gigs of dual channel ram and I love how it makes Vista fly.</comment>

    <title>Very Fun Game!</title>
    <comment>I like this game a lot better than Guitar Hero 2. I guess because of the song list on it. I'm looking forward to Guitar Hero 3. Buying this item online and then picking it up at the store is what I did and it was very conveinient.</comment>

    <title>Another solid album by 50</title>
    <comment>First off this is by far not 50's best work but nonetheless is still a solid rap album. If you are a true rap fan and not just like hip-hop then I would recommend this album. If you are looking for radio version songs then this album is not for you. The album definitely gets better with time. So give it a chance</comment>

    <comment>This is a great movie. It obviously didn't have the marketing buzz that it should have because I didn't even hear about it and accidentally purchased. My girlfriend and I LOVED it!</comment>

    <title>It's nice but played out</title>
    <comment>The one thing I like about Kanye West is that he raps about lots of different things. It's a refreshing feeling listing to artists that are diverse instead of the usual I have beef or I am rich artists that are out today. He speaks about his own personal issues but without shoving success down the listener's throats. The only thing about the album is that it's gets played out really fast. I went through the cd for like two times and have not touched it since. Now I would say don't waste your time with this whole 50 Cent v.s. Kanye thing it's not worth the time. A real artists should care more about the music instead of how much it makes. It felt like Kanye was going more commercial supporting this sales gimmick and it effect the album for me as well. I recommend the cd for fans and people that like to get a away from horrible artists.</comment>

    <title>Supernatural WB/CW's new hit</title>
    <comment>I've remember first watching Supernatural after being a viewer of Smallville ever since it first started. I decided to watch Supernatural because the guy who in Smallville played Lana's boyfriend in Season 5 of Smallville is playing one of the lead roles in Supernatural. The show at the time being on The WB. Ever since I first saw it I fell in love with this show just like how I had falling in love with Smallville and used to watch Buffy The Vampire Slayer as well as Angel on WB. Supernatural like all these other shows has been able to keep me interested just as much as it's initial spark of interest of all these other shows. If you are a fan of Smallville, or any of the other mentiond WB shows or Charmed I would recommend Supernatural and have a feeling you will not be disappointed. My next goal is to get some family/relatives into Supernatural like I did with Smallville shortly after it first came out even thought I was watching it from the beginning. Supernatural just shows how good tv shows can be with these day and age were good tv shows seem to get canceled. I was sure excited when CW decided to continue on with Supernatural once CW was formed through the merge of the former The WB and UPN networks/channels. I highly recommend getting this DVD Boxset. Also would recommend getting Season 2 DVD Boxset which came out yesterday and also tune into CW Network this fall for Season 3.</comment>

    <title>Another Quentin Tarantino CLASSIC!</title>
    <comment>When I first saw Death Proof I thought it was another good dialog driven, sick and twisted Tarantino thrill ride. But after the movie was over I kept thinking about the movie. Over and over i thought about it and i couldn't get it out of my mind. I realized more and more how AMAZING the movie really was. I love it! I love all the caracters, Kurt Russell revives his BAD A** side. Great movie Great movie Great movie. Don't rent it! Buy it! And sit back...... crank it up......... and enjoy:) Hollywood</comment>

    <title>Instant addiction</title>
    <comment>Heroes is a television series that I cannot get enough of. I went through five disc in one day (which I never watch that much t.v. at all). Great story and yes the cast can sell the story really well. if you never seen the show like I have it's a nice gamble to take. The nice thing is that it's loaded with lotes of extra features which gives even more to the shows appeal. This was a great buy for myself and I give Heroes a outstanding score.</comment>

    <title>Not as good as the old ones</title>
    <comment>While there are a ton of new party games, I found they all lack the fun factor I found in the old Super Monkey Ball and Super Monkey Ball 2. Monkey Target in particular was my family's favorite mini-game on the old games, but on the new Wii version, we only played it a couple times before quitting. Instead of keeping the old classics or improving them, they seemed to have dumbed them down. The single player game is kind of fun, but can be frustrating at times (much like the old games) due to the sensitivity of the controllers. I also tended to get motion sick a little bit faster with this Wii version than I did in the old ones. Overall, it is an okay game, but I'll still prefer to turn on the old PS2 and play Super Monkey Ball 2 than play this one.</comment>

    <title>Fun party game</title>
    <comment>One of my favorite games to play whenever friends come over. The animations and the board movement do tend to slow game play down a little bit, but I can easily look past that. The mini-games are fun and the overall game play is enough to keep me wanting to play again and again. Not as much fun single player, but I didn't expect to play solo much with this game, and when you have 4 people playing, it's a blast.</comment>

    <title>Feel like nonstop laughing? This is right for you</title>
    <comment>Absolutely hilarious. This season of The Office is nonstop funny throughout its twenty someodd episodes. Watch what inappropriate thing Michael will do next, see what happens between Pam and Jim, follow Dwight through his ridiculous plots and schemes. If you like comedy, you will LOVE the Office Season 2.</comment>

    <title>Great Major Label Debut</title>
    <comment>Great cd! The band's major label debut is right up there with their other albums. The songs are catchy but meaningful and will have you singing along from the first listen. The only weak spot on the disc is "Animal" which seems like filler until the standout "Ocean" finishes off the disc.</comment>

    <comment>I got this game for my daughters 13th birthday and never thought my wife and I would also get hooked on it! The guitar that comes with the game is a bit small for someone big, but is easy to use and seems to respond well to our tv's. We did have to adjust the game settings for our new high def tv, but that was easy to do. The song list brought back alot of memories from being a kid and wanting to be able to play in the band. I'd definitly tell all my friends to get this game for "their kids".</comment>

    <title>The Greatest Horror Movie of All-Time</title>
    <comment>Here it is folks: The Greatest. Number One. The Apex. The King. The Best Ever; drum roll please.............................John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN. "Halloween" is one of the most copied and admired horror movies ever. It all starts with the creepy score from John Carpenter himself (every time I hear it, my back gets a chill and my hair stands on end). It concludes with the best ending in cinematic history. And in the middle is a truly scary and terrifying masterpiece. This 25th anniversary edition is great; loaded with special features such as a great commentary with Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Debra Hill, and 87 minute (almost as long as the movie itself!) documentary, and much more. October 31st is coming up (even if it isn't), better get your copy of The Greatest (and scariest) Horror Movie of All-Time.</comment>

    <title>Skip this movie and try the brilliant The Departed</title>
    <comment>Boondock Saints could have been a good movie, but with it's cheap production values, over the top gun fighting scenes, and cheesy dialogue it swings an misses. Because of it's numerous 'fanboys' it's become quite a cult hit and, quite frankly, very overrated. While this DVD edition is decent, (although it has the always good William Dafoe) it doesn't make up for the fact that this is a sub-par movie with no brains; I'd give it 2.5 stars, but since I can't, I'll round it down to 2. So Skip this movie and try the brilliant "The Departed" instead.</comment>

    <title>Awesome BluRay Live concert performance</title>
    <comment>This disc is awesome and if you like Pink Floyd then you should know that David Gilmour is the Lead Guitarist for Pink Floyd. I wont go into any details on this show other then to say it was one of the BEST concerts I have ever seen live in person as I saw David Gilmour play live on this tour at Radio City Music Hall and it was the best $500 I ever spent for a 12th row center ticket!!!</comment>

    <title>Cool Game</title>
    <comment>I like the game its something different and fresh; however, the controls are pretty difficult, yet it takes some practice of getting use to. The only con about the game is when locking on to an enemy and its usually uncontrollable because it doesn't lock on the enemy you wish to attack. Other than saying that, the graphics are realistic and awesome, great background music, very good audio and storyline. Its one of those great games that i would recommend.</comment>

    <title>An Excellent Choice in Headphones</title>
    <comment>The Sony h.ear Clip-On In-Ear Stereo Headphones gave me exactly what I wanted in a set of headphones and much, much more. First off, they make the perfect headphones for listening to pretty much anything, mostly because they are excellent at playing music at pretty much any volume and once clipped on, comfortable enough to have you forget that they are even on your head. They will never fall out of your ear and no one else will ever be able to hear what you're listening to. I also thoroughly enjoy the fact that they have a special slider on them so that they'll never get tangled, even if I shove them into a pouch in my backpack. They will plug into just about any headphone socket and work well, plus the extremely long cord is useful, too. I also can honestly say that I think that I will not be throwing these out for a couple of years. I think that these headphones are really a good choice.</comment>

    <title>Awesome workout</title>
    <comment>I baught this video because I needed to start working out. I would recommend this product to everyone looking for a great workout. This video is great because you can choose how long you want to work out, especally if you don't have an hour to do that. This video challenges you too, and isn't boring like some videos that I've done in the past. Denise Austin is great and if you buy it, you'll love not only the video, but the results that the workout gives you.</comment>

    <title>A Surprise</title>
    <comment>I actually expected more out of this album. It's not as good as I thought it was going to be, but I still love it. The beats are amazing. The lyrics were good. This is an album that you have to have a system in your trunk for. I think it's still a pretty dope album. Big brother is AMAZING!!! Kanye couldn't have gotten any more real on that song!</comment>

    <title>Impressive Post-Rock Release</title>
    <comment>The first official release by this Canadian, post-rock group; is a powerful debut record. The record features sound clips with emotional, instrumental music. A great buy for any fan of artist such as: Mogwai, Explosions in the Sky, and any other post-rock recording.</comment>

    <title>Amazing sound and video, even for non-fans</title>
    <comment>I would recommend this blu-ray mainly to those consumers who have a high end sound system. The dolby true HD track on here is among the best sound tracks I've ever heard, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't even consider himself a Dave Matthews fan. The video is also incredibly detailed and lifelike. I strongly recomend this disc, fan or not.</comment>

    <title>Great GAME!!</title>
    <comment>i really enjoy this game. The drift action and pretty much everything is awesome. Autosculpting parts is a great feature. I also love all the cars that they have added. The storyline was pretty interesting. the only downfall was that unlike nfs underground 2, it is missing the instant replays and i miss that. Otherwise Great GAME!</comment>

    <title>Excellent movie</title>
    <comment>This movie is an edge of your seat, heart moving, and action packed film. If you can tolerate the violence and language the movie will keep you locked in and wanting more. Elijah Wood plays a character that everyone can relate to and the film will touch your heart and keep your action needs fulfilled.</comment>

    <title>Good buy</title>
    <comment>I used this several times already and it has easily and successfully repaired discs with superficial scratches and dirt. The cleaning supplies are ingeniously stored within the machine so it is easy to keep everything together. The only drawback is that this does not come with the adapter. The adapter has to be ordered for an additional charge.</comment>

    <title>A Few Good Lines</title>
    <comment>A Few Good Men is a movie about honor truth and the fued between army and navy. There are some famous lines in this movie but the only one that comes to mind is the," YOU CAN"T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!"...which by the way is very moving up to that point of the movie. I think that this movie is recommended because it does bring up some very interesting points on moral values and what is right. Yay...an inspirational movie at last.</comment>

    <title>Good Upgrade For Microsoft</title>
    <comment>Microsoft did a wonderful job with this upgrade for Microsoft office. 2007 introduces a new ribbon feature at the top, this makes finding and editing the documents extremely easy. One downside is that if you are in a hurry and are not careful, you might save the document as a "docx" file which is the 2007 version of the word document. This may present a problem because many schools and public places do not have Microsoft office 2007 and you will not be able to open the document. Although this problem is easily fixed if you just save the file as a 199X-2003 document. Overall a great job on Microsoft's behalf. I would recommend.</comment>

    <title>Different than there first</title>
    <comment>Eisley's second album is different than there first. They have grown up on this record. The tone is more mature. The biggest shock is there is some serious rocking going on esp. on the first track. This is a great album esp. for people who love great singing.</comment>

    <title>A Must Have</title>
    <comment>If you are still stuck in the 80's, like myself, or you are just a fan of 80's alternative music, then you must have this CD in your collection. The Smits helped shape a genre of music that is still as wonderful today as it was two decades ago.</comment>

    <comment>It's been a while since I purchased a video game from this genre. Pretty good game play. I like the two player abilities of it, it's fun to do a duel with a another player. Graphics are great and the game as a whole can keep you very well entertained.</comment>

    <title>Gotta Love The Shins!</title>
    <comment>The Shin's first album "Oh Inverted World" is WONDERFUL! The Shins have an energetic style that permeates even their more mellow songs. The album is riveting from start to finish, from the first whistle to the last acoustic riff. Their songs have incredible harmonies and an exciting foot-tapping beat. I love the poetic allure of the lyrics, which are bizarre and at first glance, random, and enjoy puzzling over their meanings or wondering whether they even have a meaning. I highly recommend it.</comment>

    <comment>This is a great followup to an already great game. The gameplay becomes more difficult quicker than it did in the first Guitar Hero, which is a good thing if you have already played the first one to death. In this version, you can choose lead, rhythm, or bass guitar. It also allows two players to play a the same time and offers a practice mode.</comment>

    <title>A big waste of $20.00!!!!!!</title>
    <comment>I have had one of these for about 6 months. I have used it 3 times. The thing dies the 4th time I plug it in. It was stored in the glove box by itself. I have checked the fuse like the directions say and it is good. I have searched the web for the manufacturer to complain and they are not to be found. Save your money buy a better model and maybe it will last for the fourth recharge! If I wrote the "expletives deleted" that I would need to describe my unhappiness with this product, I know that I would offend all of you!</comment>

    <title>Jah Rastafari!</title>
    <comment>I was so happy to see these headphones hit the market. I always felt like traditional white and black didn't allow me to express myself and the music I listen to. I am all about reggae so the Skullcandy let me feel the rhythmns and the beats and let me support Ethiopia and Jah Rastafari. The headphones themselves are amazing they cancel a good amount of outside noise and let you hear the bass from a min to a max of volume control on the cord itself. The nicest feature is the option to switch sizes of ear buds! all around a good product!</comment>

    <title>great sound for the $$</title>
    <comment>I was skeptical in light of their inexpensive cost and my past experience being a A/V salesperson, but I was impressed. Clear sound, not booming bass, and plenty loud enough for medium spaces and outdoors.</comment>

    <title>Messenger Kit for Xbox 360</title>
    <comment>I highly recommend this product, easy to use all you have to do is plug it on the the back of the controler, is a bit tight to get it on but once its on it feels like a part of the controler , also it make the controler a tat bit heavier but you will get use to it. i couldn't be any happier with this product. i always need a keyboard for my 360. This make things much easier to use and to type.</comment>

    <comment>You MUST see the beginning! This show is truely one of the most unique shows in recent television history (then again, isn't ALL television history relatively recent?). The idea that ordinary people have been endowed with extraordinary gifts, this is something we have all dreamed of at one time or another. Not some "freak" who has come from another planet, or been bitten by a radioactive bug---Joe and Jane Citizen! the girl/guy next door. Don't YOU think it would be cool to have some sort of special ability?!</comment>

    <comment>I bought this CD fairly recently, and I also bought it for my best friend for her birthday. We both love the CD, and found many songs included that we did not have on other U2 cd's that we own. I highly recommend this CD to U2 fans.</comment>

    <title>AMAZING SHOW</title>
    <comment>This is one of the best Korean TV Dramas out there. It was funny, sweet, full of excitement and you could totally relate to this character. It is ok to say that it will remind you of Bridget Jones Diary. Still, if you like soap operas and are looking for something new, fresh, different than what is usually seen in the US then get this one! YOu will not be disappointed, plus it has english subtitles</comment>

    <title>Clever routine- creative and fresh</title>
    <comment>Ferrell makes the movie. Two male skaters competing in pairs? You have to give the writers an "A" for effort. Strength of the story is Ferrell's character and the interplay between he and Heder. Slapstick? Yes. Enjoyable? Yes. Raymond Carver it ain't but if you want to disengage and just laugh then I'd recommend this highly.</comment>

    <comment>Finally, a sci-fi series that features strong women wearing something other than skin tight jumpsuits. As a girl geek, I've had a hard time finding heroines to look up to until I found the crew and passengers on Firefly. Brainy and beautiful, not a whimp in the bunch. Plus, the men ain't hard to look at, either.</comment>

    <comment>This product is really nice and works great expect ofr we had problems with the head phones. The cd player it self was and is great but the headphones we had to exchange them 3 times before I talked to the store to get something else. The head phones would just stop working. something was wrong in the wiring everytime. other than that great product.</comment>

    <title>This is a great family game!</title>
    <comment>We got this game when we bought our Nintendo Wii and we love it! I am a 30 something mom of three boys and I have as much fun playing Mario as they do! I love that its up to four player and that there are so many different ways to play. There are lots of neat things you can "buy" with the tickets you earn during game play. My boys love the statue parade that you can play when you have purchased some statues of the characters. There are hundreds (it seems) of mini games and different levels of play so even younger kids can enjoy it. I would highly recommend this game to anyone with kids aged 4 to 95! ;)</comment>

    <title>Great Multi-Player Game</title>
    <comment>This game is awesome when you get a few people going. The mini games are great because they can keep your attention and only take about 1 minute to complete. Its nice to have a variety of challenges, individuals all against each other, pair vs. pair, and 1 vs. 3 players. I would definetly recommend buying this game!</comment>

    <title>Let's Get It On!!!!</title>
    <comment>If you've followed the development of this game, then I don't need to tell you its gonna be awesome. And if you haven't, let me update you. The control setup, you can use any controller you want. The Wii remote on the side, or with a nunchuk, the original Gamecube controller, the classic controller, all will work in Melee. Not to metion a bevy of new features and a few new characters. Don't worry, Ice Climbers aren't back in this one, but that doesn't mean the game won't be full of nostalgic characters that will amuse and annoy, aka Nintendogs. Can't wait for December.</comment>

    <title>Great chair</title>
    <comment>Comfortable, and unlike the cheaper chairs I got in the past it's still going after a year of heavy use. No rips, the fabric is nice and smoothing. Very easy to install took less then 20 minutes. Only complaint I have about it, is it's squeaky every time I rock it, which is annoying. Only thing I wish for is a thicker padding on the bottom, seems worn out but still comfortable. Very good price/performance chair.</comment>

    <title>Complete garbage</title>
    <comment>Since I have D-links Extreme N router, I told my bother to get this. His computer is the following specs, AMD 4200X2, 2G rams, 7800GT, 450W computer. Every time we install the software it would freeze up his computer. I tried it on both my computer a AMD 6000X2, 2G rams, and my other computer, AMD 4800X2, 2G rams, and they both froze up as well. Tried calling their tech support, hung up after waiting an hour. We then took it back and bought a Netgear one and it works fine on the first try. Avoid this garbage at all cost. Don't believe me, google it up and read all the complaints about it.</comment>

    <comment>This ink cartridge has consistently worked well for me. I do not do a great amount of printing. The ink lasts a long time and has never clogged or blotted. The color is consistent. The new cartridges do cost more than getting a refill, but I like the convenience and not having to worry about a leak.</comment>

    <title>CLASSIC material!!!!!</title>
    <comment>1993 was another tremendous year in hip hop. Snoop Dogg, A Tribe Called Quest, Black Moon, and others dropped gems in 93. But the hip hop world sat up and took notice when the Wu-Tang Clan dropped their first album "Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). No other group made such an impact as this group did, ok maybe in line with N.W.A.m, Run-DMC, Public Enemy, just to name a few. But this nine man group had an effective sound NEVER heard in hip hop before, and that's what made them so tight. And what resulted was one of the greatest albums ever. Here's the review: Bring Da Ruckus (RZA, GZA, Inspektah Deck, Ghostface Killah, and Raekwon, what better way to begin an album by challenging ANYONE to bring the ruckus) Shame On A ***** (ODB, Method Man, Raekwon, tight stuff here) Clan In Da Front (GZA, the genius of the Clan gets to show why he's one of the best members in the group, lyrically) Wu-Tang:7th Chamber (the entire clan, except U-God, everyone shines on this track) Can It Be All So Simple (Raekwon and Ghostface, an introduction to the supreme duo of Rae and Ghost) Da Mystery Of Chessboxin (Inspektah Deck, U-God, Ghostface, Method Man, ODB, Raekwon, and Masta Killa, just awesome and mind blowing at the same time) Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing To **** Wit (RZA, Method Man, and Inspektah Deck, classic Wu-Tang here) C.R.E.A.M. (Raekwon, Method Man, and Inspektah Deck, CLASSIC MATERIAL, one of the greatest songs ever in hip hop and coined the most popular slang term for money) Method Man (Meth goes solo on this one, ripping the mic, setting the seeds for his first album, cememting his position as the most popular and recognized member in the group) Protect Ya Neck (the entire clan except Masta Killa, classic where the group shows what they are like when they are together) Tearz (RZA and Ghostface, great song) Wu-Tang:8th Chamber/Conclusion (they conclude this CLASSIC with a BLAZING remix of the original track) It's a shame that the Wu aren't this catchy now, but in 93 (and up to 98-99), they had their brush with greatness and this classic resulted. Purchase this album NOW if you don't own it.</comment>

    <comment>This unit is easy to use and does exactly what its supposed to do. The light display lets you know when the batteries are fully charged. Initial charge took about 6 hours. It'll pay for itself in no time, considering the number of batteries the remotes would eat in a month. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one.</comment>

    <title>Expensive but worth it.</title>
    <comment>I use these discs to backup a certain kind of DL-DVD discs and they work the best out of all the discs I have used. I haven't used very many different brands but the one I had tried before didn't work. I did some research on forums and everyone said that these are the best for my BackUp needs. If you just want to back up some data from your pc I would think that the cheaper discs would work. I only use these discs because I have to for what I am doing.</comment>

    <comment>As an Advanced Algebra teacher in Williamsburg, IA, I highly recommend the TI 84 Plus Graphing Calculator. TI did a great job on the TI-82 that I bought 11 years ago when I was in high school but the improvements have been amazing. The graphs appear quicker and are easier to see and the calculator is just all around easier to use. In addition, the products available to teachers now that go along with the TI-84 Plus make it much easier on us to show the students how to use it.</comment>

    <title>Great Invesment</title>
    <comment>If you're a new photographer like me who uses a digital slr. I recommend you invest for a polarizer filter. taking pictures without a polarizer will turn out fine, but with a polarizer your picture will turn out great!</comment>

    <title>Curb (1st season)</title>
    <comment>This series is absolutely hilarious and the 1st season is one of, if not, THE best. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to laugh. Larry David is so funny and the supporting cast, his wife, his manager, his other friends, such as Richard Lewis, are great, too.</comment>

    <title>What a surprisingly GREAT show!</title>
    <comment>Another WWE DVD I felt I had to add to the collection, seeing as though I'm an 18 year and counting WWE fan. Going into this show during the initial buildup, I knew two things: 1)The Eddie (RIP) and Rey storyline would continue and 2)The Cena/JBL storyline would be over. Here's my review: Smackdown Tag Titles: MNM vs. Hardcore Holly &amp; Charlie Hass (While not a classic, this was a good way to start the show. All 4 men, including Holly, were over with the crowd, and the result was an above average tag team match.)**1/2 Carlito Caribbean Cool (w/Matt Morgan) vs. Big Show (I wasn't expecting anything particularly great out of this match. Needless to say, it seems as though it was nothing but filler, but watchable though.)*1/2 Cruiserweight Title: Paul London vs. Chavo Guerrero Jr. (A pretty match between these two. A little on the short side, if they would've had 5 or 10 minutes added, we would've had a classic. But what was given was pretty good nonetheless.)***1/2 Kurt Angle vs. Booker T (Could've done without the ridiculous storyline of Angle being somewhat sexually obsessed with Booker T's wife, when everyone should know that Angle's a married man with a child. Completely ignoring the storyline, this was another pretty good, with a logical ending.)***1/2 US Title: Orlando Jordan vs. Heidenreich (Take a pass on this match. Why would anyone put the US title on heatless Orlando Jordan is beyond me. Complete filler here.)* Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero (The storyline @ the beginning was a little tense, but when you have these two, you can be guaranteed a great match, and that's exactly what this was. Even though it was better than their Wrestlemania 21 match (which was great also), this was excellent, but loses points due to the DQ finish.)**** WWE Title - I Quit Match: John Cena vs. JBL (This is the type of match that should've taken place @ Wrestlemania 21. What an awesome, wild brawl between these two, effectively ending this storyline. Basically JBL's best match ever, maybe Cena's.)****1/4 Overall, this was a great show. You had two pretty good matches in Chavo/London and Angle/Booker, an excellent Eddie(RIP)/Rey match, and a wild JBL/Cena match. You have my recommendation on this one.</comment>

    <title>The 2005 Royal Rumble Rocks!!!!</title>
    <comment>Well, I just recently purchased this particular DVD. I was a little skeptical about buying it again. @ first, several months ago, I purchased it, but I traded it back because I didn't like the commentary in the Royal Rumble (I know that should be an issue). So, @ this particular time, I've purchased this DVD again. With this review, lets see if a couple of months of time have been kind to this event. Here's my review: Shawn Michaels vs. Edge (During the initial buildup to this match, I thought this was going to be a classic. After viewing this match, I was somewhat disappointed, but that's *not* a knock on this match @ all. The slow portion in the middle of the match kind of deducts points away from the rating, but the rest of the match was pretty solid.)*** Undertaker vs. Heidenreich, Casket Match (I wasn't thrilled with this storyline, but I've been a fan of the Undertaker for years. Not a horrible match, but what you see is what you get. And anyone who's been watching the Undertaker during his career should know the outcome.)*1/2 Kurt Angle vs. JBL vs. The Big Show, WWE Title (Wow. Surprisingly, this match was *too short*. It seems they were getting into the groove around the time when Big Show clotheslined JBL through the ringside barricade. Everyone, including JBL and Big Show, had their working boots on, and the result was a pretty good match.)***1/2 HHH vs. Randy Orton, World Heavyweight Title (Man, did this match just lumber around with no flow. Everyone kind of knew that HHH was going to win this one, with Orton's original push flopping badly. They could've turned it up on this one, but it turned out to be merely average this time around.)** The 2005 Royal Rumble match (Wow, if there was ever a match that I shortchanged, this was it. This was an excellent Rumble match, with great performances from the WWE superstars. After listening to JR and Tazz's commentary, who by the way make a fine play by play duo, it wasn't all that bad like I previously thought. There were some fine moments in this Rumble, such as the Benoit/Eddie moments, Holly, Benoit, and Eddie showing Puder what paying dues is all about, Batista's domination, Paul London's bump of the night, etc.)**** Overall, what can I say? I did shortchange this event @ first, but after viewing it a little more objectively than I did other events, it's a pretty good show. You have a solid Michaels/Edge match, a pretty good Angle/JBL/Big Show match, and an excellent Royal Rumble match. Recommended.</comment>

    <title>No Way Out 2006 was pretty good!</title>
    <comment>just got finished watching this event, seeing as though I purchased this on the day it was released. And for this event, I can say it was actually pretty good. For the final pay per view before Wrestlemania 22, here's my review for WWE No Way Out 2006: Cruiserweight Match for the WWE Cruiserweight Title: Gregory Helms vs. Kid Kash vs. Funaki vs. Psicosis vs. Brian Kendrick vs. Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Nunzio vs. Super Crazy vs. Paul London (This was certainly a good way to begin the show, as usual with the cruiserweights. The action was kind of non stop, and it did get the fans pumped up for the rest of the card, which is all you can ask for.)*** JBL vs. Bobby Lashley (As much as I'm not a big fan of JBL inside the ring, he's good on the mic, and he did a fairly good job in carrying Lashley in this match. Not outstanding, but above average.)** Matt Hardy &amp; Tatanka vs. MNM (Well, what can I say about Tatanka being the mystery partner? Didn't set the world on fire, but I don't anything too negative to say about this match @ all. Hardy and Tatanka pinned the tag team champions in this non title match, but to my knowledge, they were never given the number one contender status.)**1/2 Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton for Mysterio's Wrestlemania title opportunity (Man, did I want Rey to win this match, but instead Mr.Orton had to cheat to win. Didn't care for the inclusion of the late great Eddie Guerrero for this storyline, but this match was also pretty good as well. How many of you out there would like to see just Angle vs. Rey Mysterio @ Wrestlemania 22 for the title? That would be an instant 5 star classic.)***1/2 Kurt Angle vs. The Undertaker, World Heavyweight Title (WOW! This match was stellar! It was breathtaking to watch this match, as both men delivered amazing performances, especially with the counter wrestling and the submissions. Not 5 stars, but definitely awesome.)****1/4 Overall, this was a PRETTY GOOD show, better than the Royal Rumble event this year. An awesome main event, one pretty good title match, and a pretty good Rey/Orton, makes this worth the price. Recommended.</comment>

    <title>Wrestlemania XIX fires on all cylinders!!!!!!!!!</title>
    <comment>Looking back on it, Wrestlemania XIX was a fairly anticipated show @ the time. A the time, almost 4 months into 2003, Brock Lesnar won the Royal Rumble, Kurt Angle &amp; HHH were champions, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, and Steve Austin (among others) were set to return, Shawn Michaels making his return to Wrestlemania, Goldberg was going to make his long awaited WWE debut. All things considered, this had the makings to be a blockbuster show. Here's my review: March 30, 2003; Safeco Field; Seattle, WA 1. WWE Cruiserweight champion Matt Hardy vs. Rey Mysterio, (A criminally short match between these two. If given more time, this could've been classic, but it's an above average match to say the least.)**1/2 2. The Undertaker vs. The Big Show &amp; A-Train in a handicap match,(Originally, Nathan Jones was going to team with the Undertaker, but he was "taken out of action" during the Heat episode before this show. Undertaker defeated Show and A-Train in this match. Not that watchable.)* 3. WWE Women's champion Victoria vs. Trish Stratus vs. Jazz in a triple threat match, (Another fairly average match for the women's division.)** 4. WWE tag team champions Shelton Benjamin &amp; Charlie Haas vs. Eddie &amp; Chavo Guerrero in a triple threat match, (Not a bad match @ all. These teams could've had a much better match, but with the next set of matches, we could see that more time was given to the main matches.)**1/2 5. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Jericho, (HBK made his grand return to Wrestlemania in this classic match. I enjoy this one every time I watch it.)****1/4 6. World champion Triple H vs. Booker T, (Myself and others thought that Booker T was going to leave as champion, but HHH ended up winning in the end. Not a bad match per se, barely good, but not great.)**1/2 7. Hulk Hogan vs. Vince McMahon in a street fight, (Wow, when you have TWO legendary senior citizens competing, can you have a decent match? In the case of these two, you can. Even though it was overbooked, it still was a decent match considering the people involved.)**1/2 8. The Rock vs. Steve Austin (After viewing this match on many occasions, it deserves four stars. Both men truly worked in this one, with Rock FINALLY defeating Austin @ Wrestlemania. Not better than the Wrestlemania X-Seven match, but 50% better than the Wrestlemania XV match.)**** 9. WWE champion Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar, (Two decorated athletes putting on a wrestling clinic in the main event. Everyone knew this was going to be Angle's last match for a while because he had to have neck surgery, other than that, this was a fantastic match.)****1/4 Extra Features as well Alternate Spanish Commentary Wrestlemania 3rd Degree The Road to Wrestlemania: Wrestlemania Press Conference in Seatle (September 24, 2002) Edge's Wrestlemania Media Tour Wrestlamania Press Conference in New York City Wrestlemania Weekend: Trish Stratus - Full Axxess World Tag Team Championship from Sunday Night Hear before Wrestlemania: Chief Morley &amp; Lance Storm vs. Rob Van Dam &amp; Kane (*1/2) From Sunday Night Heat: Attack on Nathan Jones Post-Match Commnets: Victoria, Rey Mysterio, A-Train, Nathan Jones, Stacy Keibler &amp; Torrie Wilson Wrestlemania Retro - Superstars reveal their favorita 'Mania moment: Christian, D-Von Dudley, Rob Van Dam, Shawn Michaels, Big Show, Spikey Dudley, Bubba Ray Dudley, Diamond Dallas Page, Trish Stratus and Steve Austin Wrestlemania Feature: Wrestlemania 1: The Beginning Wrestlemania Celebrity Celebrity Moments Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania Undertaker Undefeated Comments on Hogan vs. McMahon - 20 Years in the Making: Gene Okerland and Bobby Heenan Wrestlemania Promotional Spots: Wrestlemania Image Spot, Wrestlemania - 4 Main Events The Catfight Girls: Lunch, The Pool, The Rock vs. Austin Mr. McMahon Training Vignettes: At Trax Training Center, In the Weight Room The Night after Wrestlemania XIX: Goldberg Debuts on Raw (March 31, 2003) Easter Egg Go to the "Chapters" section on disc 2 and highlight "The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin" match and press the right arrow on your remote control. It will take you to a six-minute segment with The Rock interrupting Steve Austin's autograph session at the Fax Axxess party in Seattle. Overall, this was a great show, the best WWE show in the year 2003. Recommended.</comment>

    <title>Classic Desperate Housewives</title>
    <comment>While DH Season 2 seemed to stray a little from the comedic and emotional quirkiness that got people hooked on this show initially, Season 3 brings the fun back in full force. Emotional, raw, blunt, yet hilarious, Desperate Housewives Season 3 is not to be missed. If you haven't seen Seasons 1 and 2 before buying this, you'll be hooked - whether you watch just one or all of the S3 episodes.</comment>

    <title>Great DVD for 4 Horseman Fans</title>
    <comment>This DVD is one of the best wrestling DVDs that I have ever purchased. The story about the greatest faction in wrestling was excellent. There wouldnt have been D-X or NWO if it wasnt for the 4 Horseman. Wish they were back on TV. Wrestling could use it. I would recommend this for any wrestling fan.</comment>

    <title>An awesome DVD on the Snakeman</title>
    <comment>didn't think @ the time that they were going to release a DVD on Jake Roberts. But after I watched this the first time, I'm glad they did. First things first, Jake Roberts, no matter what kind of personal problems he may have had in the past, the guy is a TRUE legend. This DVD is as in depth as any WWE DVD I've recently purchased. It gave me certain information about Jake that I didn't previously know. The documentary portion of the DVD is awesome, and it's required viewing for all fans, especially long time fans like me. Here's my review on the extra matches: Disc One Matches vs. Ricky Steamboat, Snake Pit Match - The Big Event 8/28/86, ***1/2 (Jake and Steamboat had a great feud around this time, and this is one of the highlights of that feud. One of Jake's best matches.) vs. Honky Tonk Man - Wrestlemania III 3/29/87, *1/2 (Still a shocking upset to this day, Honky Tonk beat Jake in this match, still watchable though.) vs. "Ravishing" Rick Rude, Rude Awakening vs. DDT Match - MSG 10/24/88, ** (Another great feud during this time for Roberts. Rude was after Jake's wife @ the time, and the result was a HOT storyline, Jake got the win in this one.) Snakes Bites (Extras) Jake's relationship with children How he became "The Snake" Working with Dynamite Kid Legion of Doom "Steamboat saved my life..." Meeting Dick Ebersol "Snake" on the loose... Grizzly Smith Hogan/Jake Feud Easter Eggs on Disc One In the Chapters section, click right twice on "Growing Up" for Jake telling a personal story about being worked by his father after a match In the Snake Bites section, click right twice on "Legion of Doom" for a clip of Animal finishing the story he started about King Kong Bundy on the Snake Bites clip In the Snake Bites section, Click left twice on "Grizzly Smith" for a clip of Hulk Hogan talking about an experience he had with Jake's father on a road trip. Disc 2 - Matches: w/ Ricky Steamboat vs. Jim Nelson &amp; Mike Miller - Mid-Atlantic, 9/9/81, *1/2 (Average match, but watchable.) vs. Ronnie Garvin, World TV Title - Georgia Championship 12/3/83, ** (Not a bad match, but they did show some energy in this one.) vs. "Leaping" Lanny Poffo - MSG 3/16/86, *1/2 (Jake's debut match in the WWF. Pretty average to say the least.) vs. Earthquake - Superstars 4/27/91, (No match. Once things appear to get going, Earthquake "squashes" Jake's snake in the bag, actually sitting on it.) After a match, Jake "The Snake" Roberts attacks Randy "Macho Man" Savage with a cobra - Superstars 11/23/91 vs. Sting, Coal Miners Glove Match - Halloween Havoc 10/25/92, *1/2 (Another fairly average match. Worth a look to see Jake face Sting for the first &amp; last time.) vs. Dirty White Boy, Smokey Mountain Title - Smokey Mountain Wrestling 5/7/94, * (Not very good, but semi-ok.) vs. "Stone Cold" Steve Austin - King of the Ring 6/23/96, ** (If it wasn't for this match, there would be no Stone Cold Steve Austin, bottom line. Watch Austin's promo @ the end of this match.) vs. Jerry "The King" Lawler - Summerslam 8/18/96, DUD (Pretty much a squash almost, Jake quickly disposes of Lawler with the DDT.) Run-in during Tommy Dreamer vs. Jerry "The King" Lawler - Hardcore Heaven 8/17/97 w/ Tommy Dreamer vs. Justin Credible &amp; Jack Victory - November 2 Remember 11/1/98, ** (This is your standard ECW match.) Interviews &amp; Promos: Vince McMahon interviews Jake - TNT 3/14/86 "Ravishing" Rick Rude hits on Cheryl Roberts - Superstars 4/23/88 Brother Love interviews Jake &amp; Cheryl Roberts - Wrestling Challenge 1/27/90 Promo about threatening Ted Dibiase with snakes - Superstars 3/3/90 Fights with Brother Love during interview - Superstars 10/27/90 Interview on The Barber Shop - Wrestling Challenge 5/11/91 Ultimate Warrior Casket Vignette - Superstars 8/3/91 Ultimate Warrior Cemetery Vignette - Superstars 8/10/91 Ultimate Warrior Snake-Filled Room Vignette - Superstars 8/17/91 Mean Gene Okerlund interviews Jake - Superstars 3/14/92 The Snake Pit: w/ Kamala, The Wizard &amp; Kim Chee - Wrestling Challenge 9/6/86 w/ Junkyard Dog - Wrestling Challenge 10/18/86 w/ Hulk Hogan - Wrestling Challenge 11/22/86 DVD Bonus: Excerpts from various books by WWE Legends including: Superstar Billy Graham "Tangled Ropes", Jerry Lawler "It's Good to Be the King... Sometimes" &amp; Freddy Blassie "Listen, You Pencil Neck Geeks"! Disc 2 Easter Eggs Click left twice on "with Ricky Steamboat vs. Jim Nelson and Mike Miller" for a Steamboat and Roberts promo regarding this match. Click right twice on "vs. Ronnie Garvin" for a Gordon Solie interview of Paul Ellering and Jake Roberts from Georgia Championship Wrestling. Cleck left twice on "vs. Earthquake" for a clip from Superstars on April 6th, 1991 where Roberts spooks Tenta and Jimmy Hart with the snake Overall, I have a few comments: #1) If you want this DVD for the matches ONLY, and you're looking for quality and you're not into the old school wrestling, this DVD is not for you. #2) If you're a nostagic fan, such as myself, and you like the classic WWF footage and matches to boot, high recommendation. #3) If you're just a fan of Jake Roberts, overall, another high recommendation. In the end, you won't go wrong with this purchase.</comment>

    <title>AWESOME AWESOME!!!!!</title>
    <comment>Ever since it's introduction in 2002, I have NEVER been a fan of the WWE's brand extension (I hope they end it once and for all). But as it relates to this Raw PPV, it is the BEST RAW PPV and the best overall brand PPV ever, and that's saying a lot. You'll truly see why in my review of this event: Carlito vs. Shelton Benjamin - Intercontinental Title, ***(A good way to start off the show and get the crowd hyped, Carlito picks up the victory in this one) Christy Hemme vs. Victoria, *1/2 (standard women's match here, nothing special about this one) Kane vs. Edge, ** (Man, these two feuding 1 year prior to this event, with the storyline here being as weird as this one in 04, an average match to be sure, but the EXCELLENCE begins from here) By the way, before I get to the final three matches, please skip the segment with Viscera, Lilian, and the Godfather. Don't even bother with those. Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle, ****3/4 (I'm actually torn on the rating for this one. For the Wrestlemania 21 match, I gave it 5 stars, as this one is close to that rating too. This was another CLASSIC match in their series. Not better than the original, but it's STILL excellent.) John Cena vs. Christian vs. Chris Jericho - WWE Title, **** (Yes, this deserves 4 stars. This was another excellent match. It's too bad that Christian left for TNA. Other than that, each star delivered great performances here.) Batista vs. Triple H - World Title Cell Match, ****1/4 (Wow. What a GREAT match this was. Batista had already defeated HHH twice. But in this match, HHH REALLY put Batista over as something special.) Overall, I truly recommend the DVD to any fan. You won't regret this purchase. You have Michaels vs. Angle II, Batista vs. HHH III, and Christian in first match for the WWE title. What more can you ask for!!!</comment>

    <title>Talented superstar</title>
    <comment>Even though he unfortunately passed away last year, Eddie Guerrero will ALWAYS live in the mind of wrestling fans worldwide. He may have had his demons outside of the right, but inside of the squared circle, Eddie could perform with ANYONE. He did it with style and grace, and this 2 DVD set highlights why. Here's my review of the matches: Disc 1 Hector, Chavo &amp; Mando Guerrero vs. Cactus Jack &amp; Rock 'n' Roll RPMs (AWA Superclash III - Chicago, Ill. - 12/13/1988), **1/2 (A fairly decent match here.) Hair vs. Mask: Eddie Guerrero &amp; Art Barr vs. El Hijo Del Santo &amp; Octagon (When Worlds Collide - Los Angeles, Cal. - 11/6/1994), ***** (Yep, our first Match of the Year candidate here. Just all around awesomeness here.) 2 Out of 3 Falls: Eddie Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko (ECW - Philadelphia, Penn. - 8/26/1995), ****1/2 (Both of these men were on there way to WCW, as this match serves as their ECW swan song. What a great way to go out on.) Alternate Commentary by Dean Malenko and Eddie Guerrero WCW Cruiserweight Title: Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Jericho (WCW Fall Brawl - Winstom-Salem, N.C. - 9/14/1997), ****1/4 (A classic match between these two in the opening match, which was the usually case for a WCW event back in those days.) Mask vs. Title - WCW Cruiserweight Title: Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio (WCW Halloween Havoc - Las Vegas, Nev. - 10/26/1997), ***** (Another Match of the Year candidate. This was one of WCW's best matches ever, as it was also the best match for both of these athletes.) Alternate Commentary by Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio Disc 2 Hair vs. Hair: Eddie Guerrero vs. Chavo Guerrero (WCW Bash at the Beach - San Diego, Cal. - 7/12/1998), ** (Not one of their finest moments to be sure. Could've been a lot more, but they were hampered with a ridiculous storyline @ this point in 1998 WCW.) Ladder Match - Intercontinental Title: Eddie Guerrero vs. Rob Vam Dam (RAW - Edmonton, Alberta - 5/27/2002), ****3/4 (A totally awesome match, one of the greatest matches in the history of RAW. The ONLY reason this match is NOT 5 stars is the fact that RVD tried the frog splash FROM THE TOP OF THE LADDER, but he sadly blew the spot.) Alternate Commentary by Eddie Guerrero and Rob Van Dam Triple-Threat Elimination Match - WWE Tag Team Titles: Eddie &amp; Chavo Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle &amp; Chris Benoit vs. Edge &amp; Rey Mysterio (WWE Survivor Series - New York City, N.Y. - 11/17/2002), ***1/2 (We hit a match that should've been a 5 star match, but the storyline here was starting to wear thin @ that point. It was still very good though.) Finals of WWE U.S. Title Tournament: Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit (WWE Vengeance - Denver, Col. - 7/27/2003), **** (Guerrero captures the US title here in an excellent match with Benoit.) WWE Championship Title: Eddie Guerrero vs. Brock Lesner (WWE No Way Out - San Francisco, Cal. - 2/15/2004), ****1/4 (I was surprised when Eddie won the title on this night. They delivered a truly awesome match here that entertained.) Easter Eggs Easter Egg: Hector Guerrero Discusses the Gobbledy Gooker How To Access: On Disc One, Go to Extras. Click left on AWA Superclash and the clip will play Easter Egg: Eddie Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko How To Access: On Disc One, Go to Extras. Click left on ECW and a video on the classic Malenko vs. Guerrero feud will play Easter Egg: Triple Threat Tag Video How To Access: On Disc Two, Go to Extras. Click left twice on WWE Survivor Series and a video promoting the Benoit &amp; Angle vs. Los Guerreros vs. Edge &amp; Mysterio bout will play. Easter Egg: Eddie Guerrero vs. Brock Lesnar How To Access: On Disc Two, Go to Extras. Click left twice on No Way Out and a video on Lesnar vs. Guerrero will play. Easter Egg: Eddie Guerrero's first Match How To Access: In the Extras Session, click left on Fighting for Honor. A clip of Guerrrero discussing his first ever match will play. . Easter Egg: Eddie's tattoo How To Access: On Special Extras, click left twice on Injury. Eddie will discuss the cross tattoo on his left arm. Overall, what we have here is another awesome DVD set, this time about the late great Eddie Guerrero. Another high recommendation for this legend. R.I.P. Eddie Guerrero</comment>

    <title>I LOVE THE 80s!!!!!</title>
    <comment>Lately I've been (and always have been) on a nostagia kick, more so than the average fan. It's something about the 80s (the WWF) that I love so much I just can't identify it (I know I sound markish, but bare with me here!). This 3 DVD set about the Greatest Wrestling Stars of the 80s is a definite testament to the trend setters as far as the 1980s go. Maybe the reason why I appreciate the 80s so much is because if it wasn't for the 80s, there wouldn't be a wrestling business today, and for that, I appreciate the decade of the 1980s. Here's my review of the matches with a little extra material as well: (Note: Workrate fans, try not to take these ratings TOO seriously. This is the 80s I'm talking about here, so even though there is ONE 5 star match, try not to search for TOO MANY of them here. My ratings are based on real feelings and nostagic purposes. I hope you understand.) Also, I use WWF here, as this was the 80s, a different time and era. Disc 1 Bios: Bobby "The Brain" Heenan The Junkyard Dog Sgt. Slaughter Greg "The Hammer" Valentine "Rowdy" Roddy Piper Matches: Greg Valentine vs. Roddy Piper - NWA United States Championship Dog Collar Match - Starrcade 11/24/83, ***1/2 (We begin with a very good match from the NWA. They entertained me with this one.) Sgt. Slaughter vs. Iron Shiek - Madison Square Garden 5/21/84, ***1/2-**** (I honestly have to watch this match again. I truly enjoyed the brutality of this match, as this one was WAY before the hardcore material that was populated in the 90s. As for the Sheik and Slaughter, they brutalized each other in this one, and had the MSG crowd roaring.) Greg Valentine vs. Tito Santana - WWE Intercontinental Championship Lumberjack Match - Madison Square Garden 3/17/85, *** (A decent in the long feud between these two.) Junkyard Dog vs. Randy Savage - Wrestling Classic Tournament Finals - Wrestling Classic 11/7/85, DUD (I'd have to say that this match had no redeeming qualities, but for nostagic purposes, it's fine.) Ultimate Warrior vs. Bobby Heenan - Weasel Suit Match - Madison Square Garden 6/25/88 (Not really a match, but for comedic purposes, there is none better from this time period.) Extras: Junkyard Dog performing "Grab Them Cakes" at the 1986 Slammy Awards Sgt. Slaughter story about going to Verne Gagne's Training Camp Sgt. Slaughter story about meeting President Reagan Piper's Pit - Haiti Kid - Tuesday Night Titans 3/7/86 Valentine Back Rub - Tuesday Night Titans 7/17/86 Bobby Heenan Show with Guest Jameson Winger - Prime Time 7/10/89 Disc 1 "Easter Eggs" Highlight &amp; click the Chapters option on the main menu &amp; highlight the Roddy Piper button and push the right arrow button twice. A promo by Roddy Piper in Mid-Atlantic will play of Piper talking about wanting the World Title. Highlight &amp; click the Extras option on the main menu &amp; on the third page of the extras section, highlight the Pipers Pit - Haiti Kid and push the left arrow button twice. An interview will play with Roddy Piper telling the story about doing a promo about Dusty Rhodes having six liters of puppies. Disc 2 Bios: Jerry "The King" Lawler Arn Anderson Dusty Rhodes Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat Ric Flair Matches: Dusty Rhodes vs. Ric Flair - NWA World Heavyweight Championship 1 Million Dollar Challenge Match - Starrcade 11/22/85, ** (What can I say about this feud? Yep, they drew money back then, as Flair was one of the ONLY performers to this day who get something fairly watchable out of Dusty Rhodes, this match included.) Ole &amp; Arn Anderson vs. Wahoo McDaniel &amp; Billy Jack Haynes - NWA National Tag Team Championship Match - Starrcade 11/28/85, ** (This is your semi-standard NWA tag team match here.) Jerry "The King" Lawler vs. Kerry Von Erich - Championship Unification Match - AWA Superclash III 12/13/88, *** (A pretty good match. I'm not familiar with a lot of the AWA's material, but this match stands out for fans of the former promotion.) Ricky Steamboat vs. Ric Flair - NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match - Chi-Town Rumble 2/20/89, ***** (WOW! One of my favorite matches and one of the greatest matches of all time, Flair and Steamboat's series will go down as the greatest series of all time. This match, along with the two rematches later in 89, set standards that will never be equalled.) Ric Flair vs. Jay Youngblood - Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling 2/3/82, *1/2 (An average match here. You can safely say that Flair was still honing his style in a way to eventually emerge as the Nature Boy.) Extras: Dusty Rhodes Promo - World Wide Wrestling 5/7/85 Jerry Lawler after winning AWA World Heavyweight Title - AWA All Star Wrestling 5/15/88 Ricky Steamboat Gets His Name Arn Anderson Interview - NWA World Championship Wrestling 1/21/86 Four Horseman Interview - NWA World Championship Wrestling 6/21/86 Jerry Lawler's Worst Injury In Wrestling Disc 2 "Easter Eggs" Highlight &amp; click the Chapters option on the main menu &amp; highlight the Dusty Rhodes button and push the right arrow button twice. An interview with Roddy Piper talking about Dusty's promo ability will play. Highlight &amp; click the Chapters option on the main menu &amp; highlight the Ricky Steamboat button and push the left arrow button twice. An interview with play with Ricky Steamboat telling a story of how a blizzard caused himself &amp; Shane Douglas to wrestle a WCW Tag Team Title match against Steve Austin &amp; Brian Pillman in front of 18 people. Disc 3 Bios: Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka "Cowboy" Bob Orton Iron Shiek Paul Ordorff Hulk Hogan Matches: Jimmy Snuka vs. Bob Backlund - WWE Championship Steel Cage Match - Madison Square Garden 5/19/80, *** (A good match here. Two of MSG's favorites during this period.) Iron Shiek vs. Bob Backlund - WWE Championship Match - Madison Square Garden 12/26/83, *1/2 (A shocking moment as the Sheik captures the title from Backlund. Behind the scenes, Backlund claimed that he had no knowledge that the towel was going to be thrown in.) Paul Ordorff vs. Salvatore Bellomo - Madison Square Garden 1/23/84, *1/2 (Worth a look to see the early days of Paul Orndoff.) Iron Shiek vs. Hulk Hogan - WWE Championship Match - Madison Square Garden 1/23/84, *1/2 (Not a great match to be sure, but Hogan capturing the WWF title for the first time started the ball rolling for the phenom known as Hulkamania.) Bob Orton vs. Jimmy Snuka - Madison Square Garden 2/18/85, **1/2 (Above average match. Snuka and Orton could perform with the best of them around this time.) Roddy Piper vs. Hulk Hogan - The War To Settle The Score - Madison Square Garden 2/18/85, **1/2 (Above average here. I always wanted a TRUE one on one match between these two on a WWF PPV.) Extras: Iron Shiek Swings the Persian Clubs - All Star Wrestlling 12/7/83 PoseDown: Paul Orndorff vs. Tony Atlas - Tuesday Night Titans 11/27/84 Cowboy Bob Orton Goes to the Doctor - Tuesday Night Titans 5/10/85 Jimmy Snuka - Tuesday Night Titans 6/26/84 Hulk Hogan on Hercules - Saturday Night's Main Event 11/29/86 Disc 3 "Easter Eggs" Highlight &amp; click the Chapters option on the main menu &amp; highlight the Jimmy Snuka button and push the right arrow button twice. A clip will play of Jimmy Snuka accepting the Victory Magazine, 1983 Wrestler Of The Year Award. Highlight &amp; click the Extras option on the main menu &amp; on the first page of the extras section, highlight the Jimmy Snuka vs. Bob Backlund (5-19-80) Steel Cage Championship match button and push the right arrow button many times. The (10-5-82) episode of Buddy Rogers Corner will play with Jimmy Snuka &amp; Caption Lou Albano. Highlight &amp; click the Extras option on the main menu &amp; on the first page of the extras section, highlight the Bob Backlund vs. The Iron Sheik (12-26-83) Championship match button and push the right arrow button twice. The post-match interview with The Iron Shiek &amp; Freddie Blassie will play. Highlight &amp; click the Extras option on the main menu &amp; on the second page of the extras section, highlight the Hulk Hogan vs. The Iron Sheik (1-23-84) Championship match button and push the left arrow button twice.

If you're a new fan and you want to know what the 1980s was about, feel free to check this out. I recommend this highly. I LOVE THE 80s!!!!!!!!!</comment>

    <title>Bless these WWE legends</title>
    <comment>This Hall of Fame DVD was a special DVD to watch. These inductees all deserved to be in the hall of fame @ some point in their careers, even if it may have been long overdue. In this DVD, you get the classy ceremony in its entirety, and well as extra matches, which I will review: Disc One- Chapters: "Superstar" Billy Graham Greg Valentine Pete Rose Big John Studd (R.I.P.) Sgt. Slaughter Extras: "Superstar" Billy Graham Superstar's career (WWE Confidential - 09/06/03) WWE Championship Match: "Superstar" Billy Graham vs. Bruno Sammartino (Graham wins title, Baltimore, Md. - 04/30/77), **1/2 (Two legends in the ring, pre-Golden Age era. A great moment to see Graham win the title.)

A bad match to be sure, but good for nostagia purposes.) Sgt. Slaughter Alley Fight: Sgt. Slaughter vs. Pat Patterson (05/04/81), ***1/2 (Wow, was this match breath taking for the time. Talk about a brutal match. They figurately murdered each other here. A very good match.) Alley Fight with Alternate Commentary by Michael Cole, Sgt. Slaughter &amp; Pat Patterson Sgt. Slaughter: "I Want my Country Back" The Hall of Famers at Wrestlemania XX (03/14/04) Easter Eggs - Hidden Features - Disc 1: Go to Extras. Go to Pete Rose. Go to Wrestlemania XVI. Left click.

Valentine and Santana had a good series of matches around this time.) Junkyard Dog &amp; Harley Race Junkyard Dog vs. Harley Race (Saturday Night's Main Event - 01/03/87)*, (This match is actually from Wrestlemania III. And it's not very good to the least, but for nostalgia purposes, it's great.) Harley Race Promo (World Wide Wrestling - 06/15/83) Gene Okerland interviews Junkyard Dog (Wrestling Challenge - 07/18/87) Don Muraco WWE Intercontinental Match: Don Muraco vs. Pedro Morales (Muraco wins title, Philadelphia, Penn. - 06/20/81), ** (A semi-decent match.) Vince McMahon interview (03/20/83) Jesse Ventura WWE Championshop Match: Jesse Ventura vs. Bob Backlund (03/14/82), **1/2 (These two legends had a good match here. Don't let the rating fool you though.) Pat Patterson interview (All Star Wrestling - 01/16/82) Easter Eggs - Hidden Features - Disc 2: Go to Extras. Go to Bobby Heenan. Go to Busch Gardens. Right click. You will hear Bobby Heenan explain how "Weasel" became a nickname and what he felt about the nickname. Go to Extras. Go to Tito Santana &amp; Greg Valentine.

Overall, this DVD set is special for many reasons, with most of those reasons being these men getting their place in the hall of fame, and the nostalgia factor involved with the extra features. I recommend this DVD set. Make it a companion purchase with the Greatest Wrestling Stars of the 80s 3 DVD set!!!!!!</comment>

    <title>Same Old But Better Controls Now!</title>
    <comment>Same old Mario Party game but has better, more interactive controls now because of the WII. This game is not for solo playing. You must be playing against you friends or this game is not worth playing. Just like normal you end up with a total of 6 boards to play on. No new characters to play with or against. I would have gave it 5 stars if there was something new/worth mentioning.</comment>

    <title>One of the all time greats.</title>
    <comment>Ric Flair IS the greatest of all time. There will NEVER be another performer like this man, and this DVD shows exactly why. This is possibly the most AWESOME DVD ever released by the WWE and it will likely stay that way until the WWE releases a Bret Hart DVD. But onto this DVD. It's AWESOME like I said before. Here's my review: Disc One vs. Harley Race, Starrcade 83 (This excellent match is of much of slower pace than today's type matches, but it's worth a look. Flair winning the NWA Title is one of the special moments in pro wrestling history.) ***** vs. Dusty Rhodes, Starrcade 85 (Not a classic in the technical wrestling sense, but give it a look ONLY if you've never seen it before. Flair &amp; Rhodes had an extensive series of matches in the 80s.) **1/2 vs. Barry Windham, Worldwide 87 (This AWESOME match got the ENTIRE Worldwide show in 87, and if not for the Savage vs. Steamboat match at Wrestlemania III, this would've been the match of the year for 97. A definite classic.)***** Disc Two vs. Ricky Steamboat, Clash Of The Champions VI, 2/3 Falls (The second big match for these two athletes. Classic, classic, classic, this one IS breathtaking.)***** vs Ricky Steamboat, WrestleWar 89 (Another classic with Steamboat where Flair wins the NWA title for the 6th time. They had the greatest series of matches EVER in 1989)***** vs. Terry Funk, Clash Of The Champions IX, I-Quit match (One of the first true matches to embrace the hardcore stipulation before ECW came. A very wild, outstanding brawl, which is also the best I-Quit match ever)***** Disc Three The 1992 Royal Rumble match (This rumble match set the standard for all preceding rumbles to follow. Flair's one man show is one for the ages as he wins the vacant WWF title.)***** vs. Sting, Clash Of The Chaampions XXVII (Not that great, but give it a look if you never seen it. Flair unifies the WCW and WCW International World Titles in this match.) *** Also, check out the bonus features and easter eggs as well. Easter Eggs (hidden features): Disc 1: Go to Chapters. Right click on the chapter titled: "Barry Windham: Keeping up with the Champ." You will see a promo from Flair from the Summer of 1985 where he talks about Magnum T.A., Nikita Koloff, Buddy Landell and James J. Dillon (3:30) Disc 1: Go to Chapters. Go to the Dusty Rhodes chapter section. Left click on the sub-chapter titled: "Flair Cuts a Promo." You will see the never-before-seen "Lost Promo" from Flair!On the 8/31/85 edition of World Championship Wrestling on TBS, Ric Flair opened the show doing a promo with Tony and David where they announced Ric Flair had been awarded "Man of the Year" by the Wrestling Press International in New York. It was one of Flair's greatest interviews and the TBS studio crowd was eating it up as Flair rattled off all the names of his opponents, faces and heels alike. Only one problem. No one saw it. As would often happen, the Atlanta Braves ran long that afternoon, the interview was pre-empted,and the show was joined in progress about 15 minutes in. Later in the show, when Flair and Ivan Koloff were having a confrontation, Ivan made reference to the interview and Flair being Man of Year, but no one would know specifically what Ivan was referring to until now! (2:07) Disc 2: Go to Chapters. Right click on "Home." You will see a promo with David Crockett and Ric Flair following the newly formed Horsemen injuring Dusty Rhodes. Disc 2: Go to Chapters. Left click on the chapter titled: "Day in Life of the Horsemen." You will see a promo with Flair from June 1987 talking about Jim Garvin, The Freebirds and Larry Bird. Disc 3: On the main menu page go to Play. Left click and once the WWE logo is highlighted, hit enter. You will see a Flair promo from 1987 talking about the Road Warriors, Freebirds, Jim Garvin and Precious (2:14) Disc 3: Go to Chapters. Go to the Special Night in Greenville chapter section. Go to the bottom and select Menu. The beer in the picture will highlight. Hit enter.You will see Flair's WWEEntrace video featuringSprach Zarathustra (Theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey)(1:54) Disc 3: Go to Chapters. Go to theSpecial Night in Greenville section.Click down to "The Final Nitro" and then click left you will see the origin of the WOOOOO! and all of the Superstars imitate it including J.R. and the King and even the people that work backstage. Overall, this DVD is a must have for ANY wrestling fan.</comment>

    <title>Amazingly moving music</title>
    <comment>I have seen this show five times in Chicago and while the lead in the Chicago cast has a better voice than the Broadway cast, this recording still does the music amazing justice. The songs with Sophie in it are particularly great ("Any Little Thing" ect...). The opening number is also quite powerful and the song that really hooked me is I'm Here and The Color Purple reprise.</comment>

    <title>Bring new life to your laptop</title>
    <comment>You can bring new life to your laptop with this great upgrade. The more RAM you have the better, and this RAM definetly improved my Windows laptop. I upgraded from 512MB and it is like night and day. I now have 1256MB of RAM. Only thing you have to remember is to check how many FREE memory slots you have. The original 512MB was made up of 2x256MB so I now have 1x256MB stick that I don't really need. I have bought PNY memory before and it has yet to fail me. You can't go wrong with this brand.</comment>

    <title>Very Good CD!!!!!!!!!!!!</title>
    <comment>I Purchased this cd only having heard one or two songs that I liked. I was pleasantly surprised to listen to the rest of the cd of which I enjoyed every song. Chrisette has a jazzy, r&amp;b vibe that is very different and she can sing. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.</comment>

    <title>Grrrreat!</title>
    <comment>Definitely one of the best purchases of 2007. This CD has awesome beats and even better lyrics. It's a little different from most other Kanye West CD's. He's gone a little more toward the "Ice Rap" that he mentioned in College Dropout but still has some great lines. Graduation is a little more upbeat than the other two CD's as well. Featuring artists like T-Pain and Lil' Wayne he also tries to cater more to today. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</comment>

    <title>Great Game</title>
    <comment>When I bought my 360 I went and rented some games to play with it. Call of Duty 2 came with the system. I found myself playing this game more then the two I rented. It was a good game. It really showed the graphics the 360 had. I recommend atleast trying this game out.</comment>

    <title>Everyone MUST see this movie.</title>
    <comment>This movie was by far the most amazing movie I have seen in a LONG time. It's an incredible movie about LIFE and fulfilling ones dreams and never stopping until you have reached that point. Some parts I just sat there thinking "Oh my god...". I recommend that everyone see this movie, it's so insparational and has so much truth in it about real life and the things that people go through to achieve their goals. The cinematography in the movie is absolutely beautiful. They could not have picked a better actor. Amazing, film.</comment>

    <title>D-Links Best Yet!</title>
    <comment>I've owned other routers and adapters from D-Link and this router is awesome! The connection is constant and the strength is either excellent or very good. Never lower! The last 802.11g router I had from D-Link was usually at good, sometimes very good. I also upgraded my D-Link adapter to 802.11n; the combination is what makes it so great I'm sure!</comment>

    <title>We Love the 80's</title>
    <comment>This game isn't going to blow anyone away with any amazing new features, but I don't think that was the intention of the game. If you loved "Guitar Hero II", and love the 80's, you will love this game. The price is a little pricey at $49.99 USD, but unless you're a newcomer to the series, you know your getting quality. Hours and hours of fun to be had. Only downfall is that there are no unlockable songs.</comment>

    <title>LEMON</title>
    <comment>I Saw this concert long time ago in a vhs format. I will recommend it. The show is spectacular althouht the concert was recorded in the 3rd concert they show in Mexico City. Bono sound tire and the public does not seams connected. I know, maybe that part is not righ but if you look at it has a u2 show, it has its pleasure. the show was very well designed and sounds good. I really like the show becouse showed a stand point in concerts history...at the end is U2 who played.</comment>

    <title>best drama on tv.</title>
    <comment>I always wanted to start watching this show when it was on air, but of course, whenever it was on, I was always out doing something else &amp; forgot to record it. I'm glad the first season is now out on DVD. I've watched it all &amp; have to say it is one of the best dramas on TV.</comment>

    <comment>Bought the album after "Stronger" took me over. Only thing that could have made it better was putting the song "Bittersweet Poetry" with John Mayer on the CD - all in all, it's a pretty amazing CD.</comment>

    <title>Fun Shooter Lame Ending</title>
    <comment>The graphics and sound in this game were some of the best I have seen. I enjoyed having to figure out a way to control your team and get into rooms and take out a number of guys quickly before they kill the hostages. The number of guys and how they move was challenging and made this game fun. The storys ending was a little lame and could have been better.</comment>

    <title>Easily the BEST movie of the year</title>
    <comment>This movie is the most visually stunning piece of work I've seen thus far. Although some may argue that the plot was undeveloped, but an adaptation of a best selling graphic novel that's this good the plot couldn't be that off... All men should own this.</comment>

    <comment>Aside from the vile cover art, everything about this movie is perfect. A sci-fi action movie with actual character development. It's got romance, action, horror, drama, and Nathan Fillion. What's not to love?</comment>

    <title>Great Show</title>
    <comment>I recently purchesed this show on DVD cause I heard it was really good. I have not been disappointed. I dont know if I will watch it on tv because I watch alot of other shows and will keep this as my summer DVD show. The story is about people who have started to develop powers such as flying or time travel, think X-men. It is a story about not only the power but self discovery of the way these people deal with these powers.</comment>

    <title>Worst out of first four seasons...</title>
    <comment>As always, Cosby has some funny moments. However, from a clean family view, the lust factor of Theo and gang has grown as he and Vanessa have entered teenage years. Wouldn't recommend kids watching this one.</comment>

    <title>SUPERGREAT!!!</title>
    <comment>Superman is in many eyes the greatest of all superheros. He is almost invincable. It is hard for many to feel he is vonarable in anyway. Smallville gets around this. It is the story of Clark Kent, not Superman. The story is how does Clark Kent deal with life and how he grows to become Superman. The supporting characters help to make drama in the story. Will they find out about his powers? Will he be there to save them evertime they are in trouble? It is this conflict that makes Smallville one of the best drama's on television. Pick it up and go for the ride.</comment>

    <title>Very Good movie</title>
    <comment>It is a 4-1/2 star but because that is not an option, I rounded up. This review will be split into two parts, first dealing with the content of the movie and the second dealing with the blu-ray advantages of the movie. The movie is really quiet heart warming. It is a love story through and through. Will Ferrell is actually acting in this movie. He pulls the role off nicely without being over the top. He doesn't over act either. I got the sense watching this movie that this is more of his true personality. The supporting cast is excellent. They accent the story nicely. Maggie Gyllenhaal is again excellent; her character is seems like it may be nothing more than a radical extension of her. I was happy because the movie is light hearted, nothing blows up, nobody gets shot, and there are no epic wars. It was an excellent addition to my blu-ray library. The picture quality is great. Nice and crisp, nothing over the top, but HD nonetheless. The audio quality does not come from the technical aspects of sound. The sound quality comes from the sound track. It truly makes this movie natural. The songs fit every scene they are in. I loved this movie because it was a light hearted next-gen movie that added something deperately missing from collection, levity.</comment>

    <comment>This is a must watch for any person that lives on the Planet Earth. An Inconvenient Truth focuses on global warming and what is currently happening due to it, as well as what the future could hold for us if we keep this negative pace up. Al Gore's Slideshow will open your eyes and will make you feel motivated to make a difference in how you live your life. This is definitely something you'll want to see, and you'll want to share it with as many people you can.</comment>

    <title>Pity Party Antidote</title>
    <comment>Anytime I start feeling down about my chosen profession, all I have to do to avoid having a pity party is watch Dirty Jobs. I really like this show. It's informative, entertaining, provides the occasional gross out (big plus there), and reminds me how not so bad my career actually is when compared to some of the stuff these guys get into. If you haven't seen this show on cable - Look For It. If you have seen it, you either love it or hate it. For those who love it - now you can own it. I give it one big DIRTY buy recommendation.</comment>

    <comment>Not a bad movie. It's a little too "kiddie" for adults, yet a little too mature for young kids, so I'm not sure which age group it's really for. There are some good fight scenes which keeps it entertaining. Overall a decent flick.</comment>

    <title>Great Laptop Speakers</title>
    <comment>I purchased these speakers for my laptop a few months ago and they are the best computer speakers I've had. I was looking at other models but I didn't want an additional box crowding by work space. The two speaker system that Bose offers is clear, precise and creates great sound for my workspace and beyond. Even beyond the laptop I can plug them into my television which is a huge bonus.</comment>

    <title>An instant classic</title>
    <comment>This is the first album I bought from the Maryland quartet and now I have thier entire catalog now. This is the second offering from them and is completly different from "Transitional Speedway League". This disc has been called everything from "stoner rock" to "doom", no matter what it is one album that kicks all the way through. The opener "Big News I" is a personal favorite of mine, a slow rocker with a jazzy bass line. "Big News II" is the harder counterpart. "Supergrass" is the highlight of the album. At over six minutes it a slow brooding song about driving in space, take it from there. I listen to this album atleast once a month, if not more. The only other album by these guys, who are now a five piece is "Blast Tyrrant". An outstanding rock record from an outstanding rock band, PERIOD.</comment>

    <comment>This is the coolest accessory to date! The keyboard is easy to snap in and snap off! Why snap off? Because it gets in the way of playing! When you are playing on Xbox Live, you need every advantage you can get! I love the keyboard though! I recommend this to all!</comment>

    <title>I LOVE OFFICE 07</title>
    <comment>I was a little apprehensive when my company installed Office 07 on my work computer, and had a few panic moments when I couldn't find the print or save as commands. After getting over the slight learning curve I absolutly LOVE this program. Not only are the menus nicer to look at but they make the program more user friendly. I don't have to go hunting for buttons anymore! I highly recommend this program.</comment>

    <title>different</title>
    <comment>As hyped as I was to see this movie blow parts 1 and 2 out of the water, I was a little disappointed in the lack-of-action. Although the story is remaining true to the comic series, I pray that part 4 (hopefully starring Tobey) will be more action-packed, and get more detailed into character development (i.e. the doctor becoming the lizard, and the leftover symbioite becoming Carnage).But only time will tell. Lets all hope this a 2-disc and will contain loads of special features.</comment>

    <title>Sad to see it go</title>
    <comment>... and I thought season 1 was spectacular! Season 2 picks up minutes after the death of Caesar, where season 1 ended and continues on a break neck pace till its concluding episode. So much material is covered in a short while yet the whole season is easy to follow and simply wonderful to watch. Bruno Heller and Johnathan Stamp continue to amaze me in their level of detail and creativity with the story line. Kevin McKidd's Vorenus has a much darker story this season while Ray Stevenson's Pullo has most things going right for him. Almost all of the other lead characters from the first season are back for this final season of Rome. Must see DVD extras include the filming of the battle of Phillipi which only lasts a few minutes on screen but must have been a royal pain to create. (Since I have never read a review that considers the role of the extras / day-players, let me be the first one to send out kudos to them for what they accomplished in the battle scenes and throughout both the seasons of Rome.) The wonderfully educational All Roads Lead to Rome featurette is also back and just as informative. All of this makes these DVDs a must-have and I'm sure I'll watch them over and over again.</comment>

    <title>Definitely a Different Bruce</title>
    <comment>But definitely a Bruce Springsteen that shows true exuberance and reverence for some very old folk tunes. It is obvious watching the DVD portion that he was truly enjoying himself. The side musicians are all outstanding and the mixture of 2 barn dance fiddles, banjo, guitars, concertina, saxophone, trombone, trumpet and drums is not be be missed. Many of the songs show the extemporaneousness of these sessions which only makes them that much better. My only complaint was the album was too short. I could have listened to 3 hours of this stuff!!</comment>

    <title>A Good Investment</title>
    <comment>Pros: easy to install, very good integration with my head unit CONs: I miss the record feature and favorties feature on my Inno I purchased and installed this unit on the same day to replace my failing Pioneer inno. Installation was very straightforward and the instructions are good. The unit integrates nicely with my Pioneer DEH-5900iB. The XM radio is presented as another source for the head. When XM is selected, three "bands" are provided. Each band provides a list for preferred channels for a total of 18 memorized channels. I'm pleased with the purchase and would buy this unit again.</comment>

    <title>Like Playing an Interactive Anime</title>
    <comment>Trauma Center for Wii does an excellent job of taking the motion controls and allowing you to perform complex surgeries. You are given a number of standard tools, plus specialized tools for certain surgeries, and instructed on how to use them through a clever tutorial tied into the beginning of the story. Once you've been taught the basics, you'll move on to more complex surgeries that require you to perform certain procedures repeatadly in the correct order, while managing the patient's vitals, your resources for the operation, and a number of unknowns that can pop up during surgery. Graphically Trauma Center does a good job of providing semi-realistic visuals that are easy on the eyes without making your stomach queezy. The controls are very responsive and give you a real feeling of control over the tools you use during each level. The storyline is over the top and filled with drama as many animes are, but this is not a negative as the story manages to keep things interesting. The ability to replay surgeries to obtain higher "surgeon rankings" gives the game some replay value even after the story is over. A solid and fun game for anyone who wants to play doctor without the messy blood or the annoying buzz from that old "Operation" game.</comment>

    <title>edge of your seat experience</title>
    <comment>This series was incredible. I was hooked the first episode I saw. I worked at Medieval Times when the series was going on and after work about 12 of us would rush to our nearest friends house crowd around the tv and watch the hour long show every week. (This was before anyone had Tivo) It was so funny because only this show was able to put 12 loud people into a room and not a single word would be said. If someones phone would ring they would get up and leave the room before answering it. There was only 2 seasons which was a bummer but it is soooo worth seeing. The time period is set during the great depression in the time of the bearded lady and the simese twins. It is about good versus evil. I love having the series. I am always trying to get people to watch it so we can talk about how great it is.</comment>

    <title>Best Hockey Movie Ever</title>
    <comment>This is hands down the best hockey movie ever created. The story is very gripping and when you realize that it's a true story you get even more involved in the drama. One thing that really bothers me about other hockey films is how disjointed the play on the ice is. The people who edit the films obviously don't pay attention to detail. This film however is very good in that area. This film is a must for any hockey fan.</comment>

    <title>Worth the play time</title>
    <comment>I have all the guitar hero games and this one is not bad, but certainly not the best one. I found the songs in the first couple of sets to be easy and only the last two sets provided more difficulity. The song list is short and the songs are OK. The 80's wasn't really known for guitar playing prowess (with a few exceptions of course). It will give the guitar hero fanatics something to hold them over till GH3 is released. It think it is priced a little high for the amount of songs and lack of unlockable songs, but you will have fun with it.</comment>

    <title>An Excellent RPG</title>
    <comment>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is perhaps one of the best RPGs I have ever played. The graphics are far superior to anything else out there, and in 1080p on the playstation 3, the picture is stunning. The world of Tamriel has a life of its own. The intricate storylines are plentiful and engaging. I played the game for 200+ hours, and my complaints are few: Repetitive voiceovers: It would seem that the thousands of people living in Tamriel are voiced by only a handful of actors. I'll forgive this annoyance only because I don't have to read all the dialogue, like most RPGs. Repetitive environments: Visually, the world is stunning, but after awhile, mines, caves, and caverns all start to look as though I've been there before. Technical Glitches: Every so often, the screen would freeze, and the only remedy was to shut off the game. Also, sometimes backgrounds/enemies don't load soon enough and "pop" up right in front of you. But until a next-gen Final Fantasy is released, this is the best RPG out there.</comment>

    <title>Easy-to-Hold, Comfortable and Versatile</title>
    <comment>The Nintendo Nunchuk Controller for Nintendo Wii is, in my opinion, as good as it gets when it comes to game controllers. I am very happy with it because of it's comfortable, easy-to-use, one-size-fits-all, and small design. It also stores itself easily. I think that a lot of people will find themselves happy with this product.</comment>

    <title>One of the Best shows ever</title>
    <comment>This is one of my top favorit shows ever. I didn't like when they canceled the season, but I'm glad its out on DVD. This season's Features include: Audio commentary on selected episodes, 3 behind-the-scenes featurettes, and a Blooper Reel. This season also has the actor Jensen Ackles who play's Alec, I think he is hot. I would recomend this show to anyone. It shows that no mater what happens in life you can still find happenes.</comment>

    <comment>Love this show, watched on TV from first episode to last. Was sad when it endded. This season's Features: Audition tapes, Blooper reel, 3 behind-the-scenes featurettes, and audio commentary on selected episodes. This show tells you that you can be strong and independent and no matter how bad life is for everyone you can make your life good. I just love this Show.</comment>

    <comment>I really recommend buying this game. Although it is older, the game is still extremely fun to play, and you won't tire from it quickly. Additionally, if you do get tired of playing the solo quests, you can play an online version of the game. Unlike current online games, this one is free, and it offers even more hours of play. Overall, this is a great game, and a great deal!</comment>

    <title>A Good Buy</title>
    <comment>There are only two audio commentaries in this set, I would have liked to have a few more. However, one of them is with Jared and Jensen, the stars of the show, and it was very entertaining listening to them talk about their experiences shooting the episode. There are also lots of deleted scenes, some bloopers, and some other featurettes. The show on its own is a great buy. Good plots, some action, comedy, thrills and chills, and great classic rock songs. If you're interested in urban legends then this is your show. The bonus features are just that, a bonus on an already good cake.</comment>

    <title>Best XBox Multiplayer Game</title>
    <comment>I've owned this game for more than 3 years, and I still play it on a regular basis. Halo 2 provides the best multiplayer experience on any game console to date. The single-player campaign plot is a little lacking, but that often happens it the middle of a trilogy, and it can be forgive because everything else about this game is fantastic. Bottom line: Buy this game and play it on XBox Live!</comment>

    <title>Don't sleep on this one!</title>
    <comment>This show is so good that it hurts. I originally caught that last few episodes of this show when it originally aired last year and I've been hooked ever since. I recently purchased both seasons 1 &amp; 2 on Best Buy's special and have even taken this season to my job (yep, you've guessed it...I'm in IT) and have gotten the rest of the IT crew hooked. We've just finished the first season and the fellas are begging me to bring in the second. We're talking action, suspense, drama, the whole nine. If you don't purchase this series, you'll be missing out on some of the best TV watching today. In short, get this series!</comment>

    <title>A great thill for a fan of the genre</title>
    <comment>The Medal of Honor franchise has pretty much redeemed itself with this new installment, after so-so's like European and Pacific Assault. The overall gameplay gives you a great sense of the chaos of battle, particularly when airdropped and finding enemy troops on all sides. There isn't as much mission freedom as advertised, but not a complete miss. Despite the new approach to shooters, there is still an issue with character AI; it's pretty much hit-or-miss. Sometimes characters from both sides will find intelligent cover, other times run right past each other, other times American troops with run right into your line of fire, then have the audacity to scold you for it! Graphicswise, it is NOT for the mediocre hardware configurations, and for good reason. Visuals are excellent, but you'll probably need a recent graphics card and a good deal of ram (1.5 gigs) for decent picture and framerate. Sound effects has never been any difficulty for Medal of Honor, and Airborne is by far no exception. The only major issue with the game is the physics. When characters are shot or killed by grenade, they seem to "float" a bit; gravity is noticeably less then what it is in our world. Be on the lookout for updates and patches, but if you're a fan of the franchise or WWII in general, this is a great buy. If you're not a fan, you're best to try the demo first. Happy hunting!</comment>

    <title>Rising action star</title>
    <comment>Now that the Jet li's and Jackie Chans are waning with age creeping up, who is the next asian action star to pass the torch to? Tony Jaa is a definate strong candidate with his sharp entry of Ong Bak. With his flexibility and real mui thai kick boxing skills, he reinvents and makes a fresh impact in to the action genre. Albiet, even in his own tongue, he lacks some acting appeal, but his prowess more than makes up for it. I havent felt the pain thru the screen so vividly or just be plainly surprised with the amount of moves our bodies are able to do even after so many years of action film! Every fistcuffs afectionado should own this.</comment>

    <title>I had to finally do it</title>
    <comment>I had reservations about writing a review for this game, not because it's weak or anything like that...no no, far from it! It's actually so good that there's WAY too many great things to say about this game in a small review. If you're into RPGs, I'm telling you this is #1! There are just so many side quests, main quests, storylines, weapons, and more that will literally keep you playing for months at a time....I'm dead serious, it's that involved! The graphics are amazing and the sound is too making for a very well developed game. "How well developed?" you ask, let me put to you like this....on most games you have to be around other characters in order for "life to go on," on this game life goes on whether you're around or not which makes it all the more challenging because if an important person in one of your quests is slain out there somewhere by another character (even by accident), then you can't finish the quest. It also works in the opposite direction where if you need to slay someone in a quest and someone else does it for you, you get the credit for finishing the quest. I have to end this review right here because I could literally go on and on about this game. If you doubt how truly awesome this game is, go out and rent it and I promise you'll ditch the rent and go out and buy the game yourself....it's that good!</comment>

    <title>Its hard to top Ong Bak</title>
    <comment>But after seeing the publics' reactions, the Protecter manages to squeeze everything you liked about his debut film and expanded upon it. Giving you more on screen pain! Facing off with a wide array of opponents, from taekwando, to giant wrestlers, and most notably a capoera duel! One most proud filming moment of this flick is a 10 minute winding staircase unedited fight where the camera does not stop which means there is no messing up. Tony ups his game and his standard in such challenges. It delivers a relentless amount of brone cracking enjoyment in much of his own style still paying homage to the originals like bruce and Jackie.</comment>

    <title>Parkour excitement</title>
    <comment>David Belle has been a pro in parkour for ages and has even spawned a couple odds and ends type of parkour flicks, but none put an exclamation point on it till this one! As a huge action fan, the human physical extremeties have always been an Asian export, but no more! This title changed my whole perspective. Parkour by definition is the French originated sport of freestyle running by where one uses the environment creatively. The basis of it is to achieve maximum movement flow without thinking. I wont go into the nice story but the situation forces a street parkour talent of David with a strict disciplined super cop. Two different trains of thought, two different styles of fighting with one goal. HD worthy all the way!</comment>

    <title>These are Useful</title>
    <comment>These are good CDs, besides the one every-so-often that doesn't work for some reason or another. Otherwise, the Memorex CDs I've burned to save my music play perfectly (on compatible players, which are most of them), and the ones I've used to save/transfer pictures (they can hold about 1,000!) have had no problems either. Price for the pack tends to vary so, if you're not in urgent need of the CDs, I'd suggest keeping an eye out for when they go on sale.</comment>

    <title>Oscar Worthy Film!</title>
    <comment>This movie features a captivating performance by Gillian Anderson, who should've received an Oscar nomination. If you're a fan of Edith Wharton you will love this movie, and those of you who have not read the novel will also find it enjoyable. The costumes are so beautiful that I found myself having to replay scenes because I was focusing all my attention on the costumes and not paying attention to the movie.</comment>

    <title>The best lie ever told!</title>
    <comment>A uniquely funny tale about an aspiring film maker Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) who makes his boldest attempt to live out his childhood dream of producing a movie. On his way to making this dream a reality, he assembles a crew and tells everyone that the biggest actor in Hollywood Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) has agreed to star in his film. But there's only one problem, Bowfinger lies to his crew about Ramsey's participation which forces him to develop creative solutions in order to fulfill the lie that he's just told!</comment>

    <title>Die Hard</title>
    <comment>Bruce Willis is so good in each of the movies in the set. Although Die Hard With a Vengeance is my favorite, everyone should see the first two. These movies are some of Bruce Willis best movies. I am a chick and I love to watch these action movies. Most of the time Bruce just gets beat up, but end the end he always ends up winning. You won't be dissappointed if you add this set to your personal collection!</comment>

    <title>If you like flight sims WAIT!!!!</title>
    <comment>Blazing angels 2 has not yet been released, I know that. However, it has been preplayed. This is definatly an improvement (however slight) over their first game. I am suprised that they even made a second. The only reason I can think of that they made a second was because of the lack of flight sims for the 360 so people actually bought this game, and will probablly buy the second until November. Now there will be an awsome flight sim in NOVEMBER, ACE COMBAT 6. If you acually enjoy flight and the way sims should be you will enjoy the graphics, controlls, and play of Ace Combat. This game will be released in November, so just wait. If you can't wait check out the Ace Combat demo on xbox live(it's free) and see it for yourself, rent blazing angels and then decide before you buy-and I think that you will agree with me;)</comment>

    <title>great sequences</title>
    <comment>For those of you that love the Chinese folk lore type movies like Crouching Tiger, you would love this movie. Mostly a romance story but twisted into the plot in an interesting way. Excellent action sequences supported with good special effects. Good English dub over. I will enjoy this one again and again.</comment>

    <title>Better than Kanye</title>
    <comment>I don't know what people are talking about saying that this album doesn't live up to the 50 hype. I have been listening since some of his mixtapes hit the streets and became avaible to those who were looking (about 6 months before Get Rich or Die Trying). This album is good and the only reason I can see for people saying that its not as good as his first is that there aren't as many as "radio" tracks on it. These tracks are hard and he even takes a shot at R. Kelly. This CD is all 50. If you look at the collabarations on this one, most of the guests are only there for the refrain/chorus. Akon, Justin, Robin Thicke, only there for the refrains. I love this album and recommend that you go out and pick this up right now. Forget Kanye's soft weak album and get this today!</comment>

    <title>Pretty Cool movie, Pretty Hot Guy!</title>
    <comment>The movie was pretty well made, the acting was good, and Brandon Routh was a perfect choice to play the fated man of steel! He looked a little like Christopher Reeve, the best Superman out there, besides Dean Cain, which definitely helped his cause! Great action sequences, mixed with beautiful flying shots made this an a+ movie in my book. If you haven't added this movie to your dvd collection, or at least seen it, definitely do, and if you like it as much as I did, you won't be sorry about having it in your collection for years to come.</comment>

    <title>Another Great Installment of Voltron</title>
    <comment>Get ready, get set, and charge your thrusters for another great installment of Voltron: Defender of the Universe! This is single handedly one of the best tv shows the 80's has to offer all of us big kids who grew up in the 80's! If you have all the rest of the volumes, this one is a must have to continue your collection. The planned, live action movie adaptation will likely score big with die hard fans and new ones alike, and these dvd collections are a good introduction to anyone who doesn't know of Voltron or anyone who simply wants to remember! Definitely, pre order this one, or pick it up when it get released, you won't be disappointed!</comment>

    <title>Great for kids with active imaginations</title>
    <comment>I watched this movie, with my 5 year old daughter, when it came out in the theaters. Now usually my daughter can't sit still when she has watched other movies, and these were movies by Disney and the like. she usually will stand up, or sit on her heels in the seat etc. For Bridge to Terabithia, she sat still for the entire movie, enraptured by the story on the screen and I was impressed. I won't spoil the ending, but it was bittersweet. I did had to have a talk with my daughter about it. We bought this movie the weekend after it came out on dvd, and we watched it again 3 times in a row. It is one of my daughter's favorite movies. My daughter does have a very good imagination, just like the girl in the movie.</comment>

    <comment>Kanye West doesn't fail with his G.O.O.D. music. He doesn't have many guest apperances but that is a good thing. This CD can be played in many different situations. Great sound. Thank you Mr. West for representing Chicago right once again.</comment>

    <comment>For those of us that grew up in the 80's watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles this movie does not disappoint. The CGI is just amazing and blu ray definitely adds to the overall experience. April as a ninja may not suit all, but it does not take away from this movie that is fun for all to enjoy.</comment>

    <title>Musical innovator</title>
    <comment>The latest piece of Kanye West' collection approaches classic on some, if not all levels. The rapper/producer puts together a free-flowing laid back album that will tug at one's ear in many different ways. He shows his love and appreciation for Jay-Z in "Big Brother." Brings a feeling of how he's living with some help from T-Pain in the "Good Life." On the hidden track, 'Ye shows more synergy with "Bittersweet Poetry," featuring John Mayer. Those are just three of about 7 or 8 more songs that show Kanye West' level of musicality in not just his choice of genre, but all music. Keep droppin' the hits 'Ye. I got ya back brotha!</comment>

    <title>We brake for nobody</title>
    <comment>Maybe it's because I've been watching this movie since it practically was released, but after all these years I STILL find it hilarious. I can recite practically every scene and never get bored with it. Awesome actors and Mel Brooks is a genius. The DVD menu makes me chuckle too.</comment>

    <title>Monster protection!</title>
    <comment>Monster, to me, is one of the best when it comes to protecting the thing i value, like my rediculously expensive (but well worth it) tv! This protector is most convient with the outlets on the side and a 45 degree angled plug. The only thing that I don't like is the led light on it seems to be a little bit much. I have to cover it with something so it doesn't blind me at night.</comment>

    <title>Much better than season one!!</title>
    <comment>this season of house is far superior to season one. the cast has developed a great deal of chemistry. The dialog flows very naturally, which creates a funny, yet dramatic show. Each episode grips you with the drama of the case, while making you laugh at whatever it is house is doing this episode. I would recommend this DVD season to anyone who is looking for a great show that is well worth the purchase.</comment>

    <title>Great Movie, but with a huge caveat:</title>
    <comment>I personally love FFVII: Advent Children. However, this movie takes place two years after the end of the video game, Final Fantasy VII. Since this movie was not really intended to be marketed to a general audience, the makers of the movie assume that you've played the video game. Thus, the plot and character development is REALLY sparse, and takes advantage of the immensely developed story in the video game. So if you watch this movie without knowledge of FFVII, you're not going to understand pretty much anything. The graphics are incredible for a movie from 2005, and I personally love the music. They also throw in lots of little touches that are very fun, like the Loz's ringtone in the church scene with Tifa. Everyone who played and enjoyed FFVII should buy this movie without question. If only to see the Omnislash version 5 at the end! However, if you didn't play FFVII, sit back and enjoy the pretty pictures and sounds without as much of a story.</comment>

    <title>Best CD yet</title>
    <comment>I am a fan of all music and went out this week and bought this CD as well at 50 Cent's and Kenny Chesney's. Let me tell you, I am very happy with this purchase. The songs are great and offers up something everyone will appreciate, from fast beats to slower songs. I love his vocal range and in all honesty after listening to 50 cents cd, I hope this outsells "Curtis" so that 50 will retire as a solo artist.</comment>

    <title>Consistently the best discs</title>
    <comment>I've done a ton of research into blank media quality online as well as 2 years of burning various brands of discs. I also scan every burn for errors, and there's really no contest. Verbatim and Taiyo-Yuden are tops in consistent high quality, with Sony a close second place. TDK, Maxell, Memorex and the others buy their discs from various manufacturers, and their quality varies as a result. Verbatim uses only Mitsubishi discs, and Taiyo-Yuden and Sony make their own. You know what you're getting when you buy these. Buy the good stuff, you won't regret it.</comment>

    <title>I love this game!</title>
    <comment>I love this game. I can't play it enough. I'm actually having withdrawl symptoms because I haven't been able to play for a while. The graphics are way better than those on Halo Combat Evolved. There are many improvements from the original besides graphics. My favorite improvement would have to be the Multiplayer option. Nothing can beat a system link match between friends.</comment>

    <title>A great Tom Clancy title!</title>
    <comment>If you're a fan of the Tom' Clancy titles, this one will blow you away. The normal style that usually follows the other games is different this time, as you can order your teammates and such to do certain actions, while you do yours as well. Multiplayer is where it's at, and as you gain multiple ranks you unlock higher equipmetn and more weapons to kill your enemies with! Granted, graphically and sound wise, this game is a must have for any 360 owner!</comment>

    <title>Great game, getting back to MOHAA</title>
    <comment>The textures and graphics are awesome, I played MOHAA for years, and Pacific Assault was awful. This game is great, kind of like COD2. It's amazing to see some of the old MOHAA boards with more detail and scenery. If your a WWII fan, grab it! Also, I'm running a 4800 X2 AMD, 2 Gig, and 7800GTX 256mb card on vista prem, game runs fine. Can't run on max settings, but close.</comment>

    <title>Fair purchase</title>
    <comment>Compared to other office supply stores and electronic outlets, the price on this item was very fair, within $2-$3 dollars of everyone else. The 95 is a higher yield cartridge than the 93 that my printer (C4180) calls for, but buying the combo pack of 95/98 is a better deal all around while getting more ink in the same size cartridge and paying less than buying each cartridge individually.</comment>

    <title>Truly a Best Buy</title>
    <comment>I picked up the kit earlier today and so far this has been a fantastic buy. It's a great buy, you get the chat pad &amp; new head set. Installation was a snap (literally) and the whole setup feels really good in your hands, not too big, not too small. The buttons feel really solid when pre press them and the back-lighting is a real treat. I just wraped up a 4 hour GOW session using it and my hands aren't tired at all and that's while using a wireless controller (heavier due to batteries). The back-light stays on for about 4 or 5 seconds whenever you press a button, so it should be pretty easy on your batteries if you have a wireless controller. The Headset is really nice as well.. it has a 2.5mm jack that you can use on a cell phone or cordless phone as well, that's fine multitasking right there! There is a shirt or pocket clip that has the mute and volume one it. My only complaint so far is that there has been a lot of echoing when I'm using the headset.. I'm not sure if its a controller issue or what, I tried the old headset on a different controller and it worked fine.. So I still need to play around with that for a while.. So for now that's the only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 rating.</comment>

    <title>BEST Overlooked Film Of 2007</title>
    <comment>Such a shame that a movie this good didn't get the attention and audience it deserved. The acting is flawless, the story is gripping; some of the scenes are so intense, I was brought to tears. As bleak as it is, it contains one of the most realistic visions of the future I have ever seen on film. Children of Men is the epitome of a MUST SEE.</comment>

    <title>I'm loving the Bon Voyage!!!!</title>
    <comment>I'm a huge Sims 2 fan, I have all the expansion packs and the stuff for The Sims 2 and I believe that The Sims 2 Bon Voyage is one of the best expansion packs ever made. I've been waiting for this product to come out for the longest and I just recently purchased Bon Voyage and I love it!! I've heard so many good things about it, too. I've seen videos/read about this game on The Sims 2 web site and it seemed like a good game play and I was correct!! I'm definitely 100%..no...110% satisfied!!! =) I definitely recommend Bon Voyage to many Simmers (people who play The Sims) who love The Sims and would like to give their Sims a little vacation! ^_^</comment>

    <title>Absolutely Amazing</title>
    <comment>In my opinion, this is by far the best Batman movie to date. For any fan of Batman, it's thrilling to see a theatrical depiction of how it all started. The thing I liked best about Batman Begins is that it focuses more on Batman and developing his character than previous installments which focused more on the villains and their plots; Batman would simply come save the day at the end of the movie. All in all, an excellent addition to my DVD library.</comment>

    <title>Amazing!</title>
    <comment>Spider-Man, one of America's favorite heroes, returns for a sequel two years after his first hit movie was released. Spider-Man 2 takes that great film and builds upon it, making for an even greater movie. Sam Raimi shows he knows what a good superhero movie is all about when Peter Parker removes the mask and we are able to see through him to understand what he goes through. While the movie may be lacking a little action in the middle, the drama is incredible. Not to say the action's bad. Doc Ock is a step up from the Green Goblin, making for more interesting, sophisticated fights by bringing four extra arms into the mix. It's everything that we had in the first film, only on a grander, more epic scale. Overall, I must say this is one of the best superhero films ever made. Sam Raimi finely assembles a grand package of spectacular fights while maintaining a proper balance of drama and story. A must for any Spidey fan or superhero fan in general.</comment>

    <title>Best new show</title>
    <comment>I had missed this whole season because I work at night. When I finally bought it I was so pleased. I thought TV had gotten so bad that there was no hope of saving it. This show gives me hope! It's about time they brought back a good fantasy instead of all reality TV.</comment>

    <comment>I've only heard only a couple of the songs so far, and I get chills on my arm listening to Tamela, she is an awesome singer, and anyone who will bring a chill to your body is worth going out buying their music, not a bootleg copy of it. Support her please she deserves it. It's like hearing Cora (Madea) live and in person. I really enjoy You deserve my praise, you can tell she has a true relationship with God. It's in the song, and I know her husband is very proud of her and most of all God is pleased.</comment>

    <title>Very good series gets off to slow start</title>
    <comment>Very good series, but I felt that it gets off to a slow start. Some of the first few episodes are pretty rough. It starts to pick up steam in the 2nd half of the season, though. Recommended because watching the first season is essential to enjoying the next 4 excellent seasons.</comment>

I'm sick of this shoot'em up, chain hangin, pants hangin, gun slangin, all the time. We need more music like this that makes you feel good. Hip hop is not dead. Thank you Kanye...GOOD MORNING!</comment>

    <title>Best RPG to date</title>
    <comment>The Elder Scrolls has a reputation for a great RPG experience, and Oblivion does not disappoint. With well over one-hundred hours of quests and battles, this first person 1-player hack and slash doesn't disappoint. The graphics are stunning, the sound is amazing, and you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat with anticipation as you play this game. Nothing about this game is simple, with an involved storyline that keeps you wanting more, and side-quests that are well-developed, you will continually want to keep playing this game like it's a great novel you just don't want to stop reading. Gameplay - 5 Replay - 5 Sound - 5 Graphics - 5 Multiplayer - N/A Overall - 5 stars</comment>

    <title>The Title Says It All</title>
    <comment>I stumbled across this show a while back. At first, I thought it would be dumb. After about 5 minutes of viewing, I changed my mind. This is much more what I would call 'reality' TV. Some of the situations this guy places himself in, I will probably never experience. However, there are some that I could and watching his experience has both entertained and made me think what would I do in that situation at the same time. Definite guy show. Okay, 95% guy demographic. Ladies, want to get your (insert significant other descriptive term here) something they would really like? I give this a buy recommendation (before your next extreme honeymoon). By the way, I really liked the Arctic Mountains episode.</comment>

    <comment>I haven't played a new version of NHL since 2003 (which is when I got married and had two kids since). Long story short, this game kicks butt. The main thing would be the gameplay using both sticks. I love the extra control when shooting. The create a player feature is just so-so compared to like, Tiger Woods, but the rest of the features are great. Lets Go Pens!</comment>

    <comment>Plenty of pictures and long lasting. I've never had issues with the SanDisk brand memory. I use to own PNY but they die out in about a year or so. Maybe it was just that card but out of all the SanDisk memory card I've purchase I can still use them. I recommend this brand for all types of memory.</comment>

    <title>action comedy to new heights (literally)</title>
    <comment>After the first receptive directoral debut of Stephen Chow with Shaolin Soccer, he trumps himself with an even more polished high production film with Kung Fu Hustle (originally named just "Kung Fu") Relentless gut busting comedy with Wu Ping (matrix choreographer) knowhow wielding some of the most amazing stylized fights with a comic book flair. Stephen shamelessly borrows and pays tributes to many of his heros of his time. Original 5.1 soundtrack is not available through the ps3 as a player only a 2.0. And english dub is available is my only gripe. This an entertainer for all ages.</comment>

    <comment>Marked as Jet Li's last martial arts film, much effort was put into it. From casting an aray of martial arts talent inclusive of (Collin Chou - Oracle's asian bodyguard in Matrix) and the giant that topples over in "Troy" by Brad Pitt's blade. Action choreography was also handled by the master Wu Ping. And inspired by true life story, Jet plays a martial artist that has lost his way through his quest to be the best. Some of the best wushu styled moves caught on film.</comment>

    <comment>This movie is in the classic style of the Frat Pack. Vince Vaughn is his usual self (very funny) and Luke Wilson is gorgeous as always (yes, I'm a girl!). The movie probably isn't the funniest of this genre but it is a good watch with quite a few laughs...great for an easy night at home.</comment>

    <comment>This season is hilarious! If you like the Dog Whisperer you'll definitely identify with the episode called "tsst" haha! At first I was kind of bummed because the special features only have a 'mini' commentary but I actually like that better now, the commentaries are insightful but not ridiculously long either. Would definitely reccomend!</comment>

    <title>reinventing the series</title>
    <comment>The original police story was in the 80s and it stopped at police story 4 (aka supercop) made in the 90s. Jackie's busy schedule with Hollywood yielded forgettable titles like Tuxedo and Around the world.... Much criticism from his fans that suggest that he doesnt have what it takes anymore perhaps sparked motivation to go back to Hong Kong and reinvent the series that made him a superstar. A darker, contemporary feel (inspired w/ an Infernal Affair flair) updates the series perfectly. He does what Christian Bale did for Batman. Jackie shows that he is still a force to be reckoned with. A tight story and good balance of action makes all fans cry for more.</comment>

    <title>guns dont kill people... daggers do</title>
    <comment>3 huges asian superstars give you a rich colorful poetic action romance film begging to be showed off on any big screen. The melodrama is kept to a minimum to make room and forge the story of a clan called the House of flying daggers who are a threat to the government. There are nice twists that keep this from being a simplistic good vs evil no brainer. Although this is a period film, there is a decent amount of sharp special effects making knive throwing very cool.</comment>

    <title>My Faith in Television Restored!</title>
    <comment>I'm telling you folks out there who haven't watched this series... Dexter is by far one of Showtimes' biggest bullseyes! Even for those of you who don't have Showtime, don't miss out on this phenominal season on DVD, it seriously restored my faith in television after years of Reality TV knocked it down. x_x Oh, and if you're scared of reading the books and then watching, only to be dissapointed? Don't, as lovely a writer as Jeff Lindsay is, the books are quite bone-dry compared to the juice you get dripping from your mouth when you watch an episode of Dexter. ^_^ Totally worth the buy!</comment>

    <title>Kind of iffy</title>
    <comment>I honestly enjoyed the multi player aspect of this game. I habitualty play online with a friend every night (ever since halo 2) and we began to play this game. There is just a bunch of random stupid things you can do in it... I.E we had a party of 8 friends and we played a hide and go seek variants, lol. But other than that i havent even touched the single player aspect of this game. It does tend to get very dull after the 1,000 Grom you have killed or the 100,000,000 wolf or bore... i would say rent this game if you play alot online with friends, other than that you will find it hard to enjoy this game</comment>

    <title>tim burton at his best</title>
    <comment>ok, just call me a big kid at heart but i loved this film &amp; have seen it many times in the theatre &amp; on dvd. tim burton has always made amusing films but this one ranks right up there with nightmare before christmas in my opinion. i wish this film were longer than 72 minutes but that's just small potatoes. the lead characters are likable in that genuine but quirky way that only tim burton can visualize. corpse bride even makes the viewer sympathize with the deceased young woman rather than the actual bride to be. at times even a bit heartfelt or touching, corpse bride manages to appeal to a wide variety of film-goers. the stop motion animation is clearly a work of genius too. although the film may be a wee bit too scary for yuonger audiences, the bigger kids will love it. there are sheer moments of laughter, suspense, &amp; even a shy romantic interlude to please the grown-ups. corpse bride shouldn't be missed. quite simply, there is no reason not to own this film.</comment>

    <title>Save the Cheerleader, Save the World</title>
    <comment>Definitely the best show in a very long time. This is a show that I had to be told about. My wife had gone ahead and DVRed the show. It is awesome and will become your favorite show after you purchase the set. From the art of Tim Sale to Tim Kring to the Hands on feel of Jeoph Loeb's involvement, it is a winner. The 7 disc set itself has a lot of great features such as the art behind the show, all 23 episodes including a 73 minute original Pilot that shows you what could've been, documentaries, commentaries, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and deleted scenes. The video transfer on DVD looks great and sound is amazing for a TV show. And who doesn't love 16x9! Stop what you're doing and go get it, trust me.</comment>

    <title>gritty fights</title>
    <comment>Donnie Yen is the hottest martial artist for Hong Kong films in recent years. You may have noticed him from films like the "Shanghai Knights", "iron monkey" or even more iconic was the battle with jet li in "once upon a time in china" His choreographic knowhow even landed him in Hollywood's "Blade 2" This movie brings a heightened sense of realism and darkness that is the trend brought about since "Infernal Affairs" The story is good enough to keep it together, but what people are after is the face off of Sammo Hung and Jacky Wu (both huge veterean talents in the industry) There is a bit more blood than previous fight films and a frenetic energy that suggests the film can't even capture the speed of their fights. The stick vs knife fight is just jaw dropping.</comment>

    <title>perfection comes full circle</title>
    <comment>if you liked maynard in tool but always hoped for a lighter sound, a perfect circle is the group for you &amp; thirteenth step is a must have cd. maynard is the unique mind behind the band here &amp; he has even brought a few familiar names in the music industry to make up this contraband. james iha, twiggy ramirez, &amp; maynard to name a few give us a startling vision which all at once brazingly honest without being too aggressive. listeners may actually find themselves amazed at how great a vocalist maynard is. some of the songs sound like dave gahan at times in his later depeche mode days but the cd never drifts into total, danceable euro-elctronica territory. most of the handiwork here features a milder version of industrialism which was once only associated with trent reznor of nine inch nails. it's hard to tell what most of the songs mean unless you have read up on the group before listening to the cd but the musical arrangements here are indeed on point &amp; the cd will keep you wanting more. if this cd satisfies, perfect cirlce's first album mer de noms is also awesome.</comment>

    <title>Two Worlds Fails to Shine</title>
    <comment>I was really looking forward to the release of Two Worlds. Following in the footsteps of Oblivion, this game had the potential to be one of the great games in the XBox 360 lineup, however it failed to deliver. The graphics were very shotty and I often had trouble with the audio during cut-scene interaction between characters. This did nothing but to detract from the game. I will say that the weapon and item system worked well, being able to combine similar weapons and armor made for a number of high powerful swords, axes, etc. Overall I would recommend that if you want this game, you wait a few months for it to drop in price to about $20.</comment>

    <title>not as shocking as one might expect</title>
    <comment>if you are simply looking for something appaling or something that make your skin crawl like faces of death, look elsewhere. shocking asia 2 is nowhere near as graphic &amp; actually bears more resemblance to the old docu films made in the mondo world series which was somewhat popular in the sixties. there are still a few scenes which will take some viewers out of their comfort zones but the vast majority of the film is no more violent or intense than an episode of ripley's believe it or not. there is a bit more flesh or adult material here however so viewers may not want to play this one for the whole family. viwers interested in other cultures or possible taboo facts will do far worse than shocking asia. i have purchased copies for myself &amp; friends. all of us agreed this was definitely a fascinating series which prompted many discussions during our get togethers.</comment>

    <title>Fascinating Movie</title>
    <comment>For anyone who really loves history, this movie is an interesting choice. Set right after WWI and before WWII, this movie brings into perspective what was going on in Germany to lead them into war. At the same time, the story focuses on Ed and Al and ties up the story of the Fullmetal Alchemist nicely. Not really a movie for anyone who hasn't seen the end of the FMA series, since it picks up after the end and might be a bit confusing, unless you haven't seen any of FMA. But then other concepts might be confusing. On the whole, a really great movie which fits the series well. Comes with a lovely booklet of notes, both historical and fitting the context of the movie to the series. If you collect the series, a definite must have.</comment>

    <title>tarantino's first calling card</title>
    <comment>not everyone in the independent film industry has the luck or the success that tarantino has with his first calling card. surprisingly, this one still looks good even after 15 years have elapsed. leave it to lions gate to give this film it's proper upgrade with a spiffy tin gas can case &amp; a matchbook sleeve with spindle for the dvd. ofcourse, all the extras are here. you guessed it. the previews, deleted scenes, etc. what more could you want? the film was great upon initial viewing &amp; still looks good today. i can highly recommend fans of this film or those who like gangster/ heist films take notice if you haven't already seen this. while not the best work tarantino has ever done, you won't feel cheated after viewing this one. the dialogue is still funnier than ever in that trademark tarantino way &amp; the characters are still amusing after numerous viewings. i often refer to reservoir dogs as scarface on laughing gas.</comment>

    <title>Best Xbox live Game</title>
    <comment>The single player campaign is OK, but the multiplayer is fantastic. The matchmaking system should be used in all online games (it automatically places you in matches against comparable opponents). Good graphics for an Xbox game. It's worth owning even if you own an Xbox 360.</comment>

    <title>Rainbow Sucks Vegas</title>
    <comment>I purchased this game at a local game store and returned it in less than two hours. Not that the graphics are bad and all. But the controls to the game are very poor, the gameplay, along with the online, is very bad &amp; the fact that you only get like three weapons to choose from. I recommend just buying it for the Xbox 360 or the Playstation 3 (which moves slower than the Xbox 360).</comment>

    <title>Sweet WWII Game</title>
    <comment>Yet another great game from the medal of honor series. This game is the best yet. Not only are the graphics superb, but the incredible openness of game play is outstanding. All new games should use this idea. Drop from the sky and land anywhere on the map. Land behind or infront of enemy lines, on roof tops, at your drop zone, pretty much anywhere. I recommend this to anyone who loves WWII fps.</comment>

    <title>Can life get any better than this</title>
    <comment>I bought this steamer through Best Buy last year, and it has made my family's life sooo much easier. No more flat iron, no more burns or ruined clothes. This steamer is soo easy to use. I am so glad I do not have to use a ironing board to lay clothes flat out anymore to try and get wrinkles our(which some wrinkles remain)The steam iron gets them all out in just a minute or two. Sames lots of time and aggrivation. I would not give this steamer up for anything. I reccomend this steam iron, if you want the best ironing tool.</comment>

    <title>Great Fun</title>
    <comment>I'm so glad Doctor Who is back! I've been a fan all my life of the old series, and the new one does not dissapoint. (Although the Doctor seems to get a bit kissy with the companions. Definitely a different dynamic than the old show.) I think David Tennant Makes a great Doctor. If you haven't seen the new series, or you didn't like Eccleston, give this season a try. It's a lot of fun.</comment>

    <title>Disappointing!</title>
    <comment>Some people may say that all 50 raps about is his money. Well, what about the song "can't tell me nothing?" Isn't that about money? I mean just listen to the chorus. I wouldn't recommend this album because It only has 1-2 hits that are good. The rest of his songs don't really stand out. Also, judging by the c.d. cover it doesn't really like "rapper mentality" as in it was made by Kanye West.</comment>

    <title>Cult Classic</title>
    <comment>This is the story of Jake and Elwood Blues (made popular on Saturday Night Live when the series was worth watching), 2 brothers that grew up in the Blues Era. The tale is their efforts to save their adoption center from the tax man. The musical performances alone make the DVD worth the price.</comment>

    <title>By Goodness, Ya Gotta love Superman!</title>
    <comment>Of all the Seasons of Smallville, Season 6 was by far the most suspenseful yet. All that I've seen was twists and turns that makes the show exciting, thrilling, and fulfilling. If you love Superman then this is the show for you. I just love how Smallville incorporates the old Superman movies and other superheroes too.</comment>

    <title>Lasted 4 years- very pleased</title>
    <comment>Tight, punchy, low-end bass. Very good low-pass x-over filter - sounded truly good even at the upper end (needed to take the pressure off my 4 ghastly OEM paper cone woofers, after which the bass really complemented them, and sounded just lovely with the 4 tweeters). Exactly what I needed in my Passat sport sedan. Added more than enough thump to my music. Lasted almost exactly 4 years, which is what the tech said I should expect. Trunk room intrusion is minimal. Cons: Wish I had teh crossover filter on the remote as well, instead of only the gain control. I hear Kenwood subs have both.</comment>

    <title>Great Buy!</title>
    <comment>This is a 2 disc pack and a wonderful buy. I stood in front of the rack of Elton John cds and couldn't decide which one would be the best for me to buy. I know Elton John has a ton of hits and more than one "greatest hits" cd. In total there are 34 tracks and they're all wonderful. The quality of the sound on the cd is perfect. I would say that this is a great buy and I would recommend it as opposed to other Elton John cd's (even if it is a little more pricey) just because it has so many songs for everyone to enjoy. It's totally worth whatever amount of money you'd spend on it.</comment>

    <title>Outrageous Beats!</title>
    <comment>I popped this cd in as soon as I walked out of the store. The beats are loud and heavy and the tracks are mixed to perfection. This is most definately on my top 5 most enjoyed hip hop/rap cds. The only thing that I didn't like about it was some of the explicit lyrics (though there is an advisory before you buy the cd). I don't mind the cursing, but I don't like the sexually explicit lyrics; that's why I gave this cd 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that I believe this cd is indefinately one of the best hip hop records of the year (alongside Kanye West's new cd). Pick them both up; you won't be let down!</comment>

    <title>WOW, AMAZING!</title>
    <comment>I really do believe that Kanye West is the most musically talented hip hop/rap artist of our time (if not of all time). He molds with the changing of times with his fresh, hip beats and stays true to himself with his down-to-earth, boldly honest lyrics. This cd is a MUST HAVE along with his other cd's. Kanye West is to the Hip Hop world what Madonna was to Pop culture. He always has a fresh sound with the most amazingly creative lyrics. This is the years best hip hop album, hands down! Buy it!</comment>

    <comment>It's hard for bands from the UK to make an impact here in the states, but Hard-Fi should NOT be overlooked. EVERY song on Stars of CCTV has a killer hook, which is hard to find nowadays in Alternative music. Give Hard-Fi a chance, you wont regret it!</comment>

    <title>INCREDIBLE!</title>
    <comment>This thing is absolutely amazing. I used to use Cobra brand detectors but noticed they couldnt detect as far out. This thing will detect up to MILES away and even over hills and around corners. I dont know how it does it. On interstates, you'll pick up a laser or radar so far out that when you finally get to it several miles later, you'll just find yourself smiling in amazement. I'm not even a speeder but I love electronics and I just never cease to be amazed by this. I HIGHLY recommend. The cost is high but it's worth it if it saves you a single ticket and trust me, it will.</comment>

    <title>One of the best shows on TV</title>
    <comment>This has got to be one of the funniest shows ever to hit TV. I never laugh as much at any other program than I do over "The Office". Even comparing it to the original British version, this show is the tops. One episode after the other - it just gets funnier and funnier. My favorite episode is where Michael burns his foot on a George Formen Grill (which he keeps on his bed so he can have fresh bacon in the morning) and Dwight gets a concussion going to get him. If you've worked in an office - you will recognize your coworkers (in the extreme) and quite possibly even yourself in each of these characters.</comment>

    <title>Rock n Roll at its finest!</title>
    <comment>If you like hard rock, alternative rock or punk rock, this game is for you. Sure, it is a rhythm game, but instead of bouncing around on a slippery mat, you get to experience the rock star poses and the swinging guitar to give your set Star Power. I really enjoy Guitar Hero II more than Guitar Hero, because II allows you to play Bass or Rhythm guitar if you want to, but unfortunately you can't use Bass or Rhythm in single player mode. You can only use it in team mode or in practice mode. That is the other awesome thing about Guitar Here II: it has a practice mode. In practice mode, you can practice a piece of a song at a time and/or slow down the speed until you can do that riff with ease. Also, in both career and practice modes, you can look how you performed on each area of the song. This helps for improving your play so you can narrow down your trouble spots and say bye bye to barely breathin' and say hello to SMOKIN' Solos!</comment>

    <title>Solid Router</title>
    <comment>The D-Link DIR-655 Xtreme N Gigabit Router is one of the most recent Draft N routers to the market. This is by far the fastest 802.11n router I've ever used. I run a web design and hosting company and have never had a problem with it. I've got 8 computer connected to it (both through ethernet and wireless). I edit HDV footage and am able to view and edit the footage in realtime over this router--something that has never been possible with any other router I've ever owned. This product is well worth the money!</comment>

    <title>Excellent alt-rock album</title>
    <comment>I just bought this cd 2 hours ago and listened to it twice. The first time I heard Dino Jr was in the early 90's on the radio with "Start Choppin" from the disc after this, "Where You Been?" and was instantly hooked. I can't believe it took me over 10 years to get another album by them but I am glad I did. Imagine Neil Young singing and some noise, garage, folk-style band backing him. That's the best deswcription I can come up with. DJ has been around since the 80's and still don't get alot of credit for thier style. It's probably cause they are from Vermont. The album has rockers and ballads but the typical semi-moody-mellow that keeps them an originator. The bonus tracks are pretty cool also. Tracks 12 &amp;13 are b-sides from the "Start Choppin" single from '93 and "Hot Burrito #2" is a cover of Gram Parson's. This would be a good starting point to get into these guys, but they never "sold out", so any disc would be good.</comment>

    <title>Great Movie</title>
    <comment>This movie is outstanding. Mixed with a good soundtrack this movie is fast paced, funny, and tragic all at the same time. Does a good job of showing the point of view of all parties in volved in the suburban America's "Crack Rock" the stock market. Giovoni Ribsi does an excellent job in the lead role dealing with the emotional conflict of wanting to succeed while realizing that what he is doing might not be as innocent as it seems. The one downside is that the DVD extras are a bit on the weak side. The deleted scenes, commentary etc. just really don't add much to the movie.</comment>

    <title>Better Than 50 Cent</title>
    <comment>This CD was much better than the other hip-hop album out this week. Kayne West's cd has much better beats and simply better music. You can put the cd in and just listen to the whole thing.</comment>

    <title>Decent RPG</title>
    <comment>This game recieves some poor ratings and I don't know why. The game was very good, with some very interesting RPG elements. If you are looking for graphics and great voice overs, don't play a console RPG. The game is definately a minimum 3 stars, but I gave it 4. The item system is fun. The spell system is fun. You can endlessly and cheaply reset your character stats to recreate yourself into any type of warrior. You can try everything and really enjoy the game. There are a couple of do's and dont's, but that's how RPGs work.</comment>

    <title>Greatest kung fu movie ever</title>
    <comment>This movie is a kung fu movie done right. It has a compelling story and acting that most movies of the genre don't have. Anyone who love martial arts films should own this.</comment>

    <comment>This is one of my Top favorit shows ever. I notice that you usualy get hocked to at least one Star Trek show and this is the one that I had to watch. So I waitted and waitted for it to come out on DVD and when it did I got it. And I still watch them over and over again.</comment>

    <title>little precious diamonds</title>
    <comment>for those not familiar with the work of tori amos, one could say that little earthquakes is the perfect place to begin. while by no means a commercial album, this one does carry universal appeal &amp; seems to be the one that most tori fans fell heart &amp; soul for. the other albums are great too but this is the one that turned me on to her complete body of work that would unfold in the next 16 years. little earthquakes is everything that a solo album should be. it's intimate, it's clever &amp; it posesses that fiery passion which lets the listener know we will be hearing much more from the artist in the near future. one could even go so far as to say that tori amos is writing songs which are inspired by our diaries if we didn't know any better. yes, she is the real deal. her experiences &amp; wisdom are every bit as necessary as the piano she plays so beautifully. tori also has the gift of a lovely voice. i would gladly state my pick of picks as far as tracks go here but every song is a winner. you simply cannot go wrong with any track on this album. if you have never purchased a tori amos album, you really need to get this.</comment>

    <title>Great headphones</title>
    <comment>I am not the most audio savey person but I really have enjoyed these headphones. They are not too large around my ears and they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time while I am working and playing on my computer. They did feel a little akward at first because the ear part is slightly angled from the band that goes over the head. This may have been because I was used to earbuds but it did take me a while to get used to it. Overall good headphones for a fairly reasonable price.</comment>

    <title>Great addition</title>
    <comment>Everyone, including Mr West himself, will tell you how talented he is, and Kayne's third album definately does not disappoint. Each song has its own feel to it, hardly ever does it feel repetitive. Obviously the singles released are hits, but also pay attention to 'homecoming.' Overall, very good deal.</comment>

    <comment>Caan's best film. He becomes the character and portrays a scary realism that makes you forget that he is an actor and it is a film. Story is good and focus of film is very good, especially for a first time director.</comment>

    <title>See where it all began</title>
    <comment>If you like the American version of The Office, check out this original British version. The American version has thankfully developed its own identity, so you can still appreciate the comedy and fine performances of Ricky Gervais, Lucy Davis, Martin Freeman, and Mackenzie Crook. One need not work in an office environment to appreciate the show's humor. There are few shows that are laugh out loud funny, but thankfully this is one of them.</comment>

    <title>Best of Marital Chaos</title>
    <comment>This predecessor of Jackie Gleason's "Honeymooners" provides laughs galore. Don Ameche are Frances Langford are terrific as the title characters, who are always at odds. Sometimes their "bickering" hits very close to home.</comment>

    <comment>The game is a must have for your xbox collection. The only negatives are how many people cheat online because of modded xboxs. The nice thing is with H3 coming out for the 360, it will be much harder for them to do. Great job bungie!!</comment>

    <title>The "fighting" of a couple continues</title>
    <comment>Don Ameche and Frances Langford again him the mark with their petty quarrels of a couple who do truly love each other. 50's radio comedy at it's best. Don't miss! Some things may sound like a relationship you recognize. An early Ralph and Alice Kramden predecessor.</comment>

    <title>Must See</title>
    <comment>I started watching this series when it was aired on TV. I missed the majority because I started watching late. I could not wait for the DVD to come out -- I was hooked. The videography, sound, narrative.. is all very immpressive. Peter is a great narrator -- got to love that british accent. I have a plasma TV which makes the picture outstanding. This series is a must see.</comment>

    <title>Change is good</title>
    <comment>I first downloaded a 60-day trial of the new Office 2007. At first, I found it a little intimidating because the new Office is quite different from the 2003 version, but after playing around with all of the new features and new navigation, I found that I like this version better than the old one. Change isn't always easy, but is often for the better; this is definitely the case with Office 2007.</comment>

    <title>Fun Comedy</title>
    <comment>I enjoyed this movie. David Duchovny's performance is superb. I remember reading a review where one critic pondered why Duchovny is not a bigger movie star, and I totally agree. He is very funny in this film. There are also some hilarious deleted scenes on this DVD.</comment>

    <title>great for keeping markers straight</title>
    <comment>I have owned and used these for many months. One of the things that I like is that I can immediatley identify them without my glasses and know that they are not the markers that wipe off my marker boards. They dry very quickly and do not smear. I like having the variety of colors because I color code DVDs. Last Christmas we sent out home movies from grandma's day that we burned on to DVD, but we customized them to the particular family that were were mailing them out too, including childhood photos of them with aunts and uncles and the like. We eventually put fancy labels on them but while we were "mass" producing grandma's home movies we used these markers. As we added photos and more video specific to each branch of the family we color coded those as we had works in process. It takes a while to write a DVD, so these markers came in handy. This was just one special project. We use them a lot. Never have had one dry up on us yet!</comment>

    <title>Hilarious Musical</title>
    <comment>The movie was very funny. I greatly enjoyed the acting and musical aspects. My favorites stars in the film are Tisha Campell and Rick Moranis. They performed well in the movie. If you like 80s musical comedies, then this movie is right for you.</comment>

    <title>Horrible product and tech support</title>
    <comment>I purchased this product because it was on sale, but that was the biggest mistake I could have made. First I tried to use the cd which didnt work so I had to download the software from their website. After that I was unable to secure the router, then after 4 phone calls and three hours on the phone numerous reconfigurations, software downloads etc. They tried to tell me that it was a problem with my computer even though I could connect to other wireless routers just fine. Then they told me it was the problem of my ISP once again going hardwired my laptop was online in no time. I have since returned it and have been highly advised to go with a different model. You live and learn I guess, I sure did.</comment>

    <title>Great Soundtrack</title>
    <comment>From the moment I heard that a movie was being made based on music by the Beatles I knew that I would buy the soundtrack. In my opinion, this is one of the best soundtracks I have ever purchased. The songs are some of the more famous Beatles songs, and they each have their own unique take on the originals. If you are a Beatles fan I would definitely recommend buying this album.</comment>

    <title>Just What I Expected</title>
    <comment>This movie is just what I expected it would be. It was a little corny, but the action scenes where actually very good. It was directed by the same person who directed the Transporter, and it shows. This was a decent movie that I would recommend to anyone who has played the Dead or Alive series of fighting games.</comment>

    <title>Give the guy a gun he's superman...</title>
    <comment>Hard-boiled is the ultimate John Woo / Chow-Yun Fat collaboration. Chow plays an uncompromising Hong-Kong cop who "works" together with an undercover cop (an EXCELLENT Tony Leung) in the triad gun-running organization. Now, when I say "works," I mean "launches thousands of bullets, slugs, and explosive projectiles into HUNDREDS of mafioso baddies." This film has a RIDICULOUS amount of gunplay. Pretty much everyone you see on screen dies at some point. Those that don't die often come perilously close to dying, before getting up and moving on as if nothing had happened. The gunmen in this film have magical powers that enable them to fire about 100 rounds from a Beretta clip without having to reload. And the top good guys seem only vaguely concerned about the loss of innocent life -- at a teahouse, or a large hospital -- except for tiny baby life, of course -- as long as they get to kill the top triad guy. And the story... well... not incoherent, but completely implausible at many points. Technically speaking, the movie is perfect. Aesthetically speaking, the same is true, with the exception of the music, which is extremely cheesy at times (the sax that suddenly kicks in during "emotional" moments is unbearable -- is that some kind of HK movie thing, or what?). Such negatives are distracting. Your ability to ignore such distractions will ultimately determine if you give this a 5 or a 9. Were it a little more humane, I'd give it a 9.</comment>

    <title>Great Idea</title>
    <comment>This charge station comes in handy for the Nintendo Wii. It's included battery packs pop right in to the Wii remotes and are ready for charging. Battery life has never been an issue for me. It is probably safe to say that the batteries will last at least a 24 hour period. LED lights let you know when your remote is fully charged. What is so great about this is that it keeps your remotes organized without lying around, and it couldn't be any easier to simply set the remote down on the station when it is not being used - no plugging and unplugging an adapter. The only disadvantage of this is that if you want to have different colored skins or grips to put around your remote, they will get in the way of the battery connection to the base. Other than that, I would highly recommend this item to any Nintendo Wii owner.</comment>

    <comment>Only two words are needed to describe Halo 3. Absolutely Awesome. Gears of War move on over. Halo 3 is going to be the best game of the year by a long shot. It already went gold! The single player is going to be amazing. The graphics are great and they have added so much more to it. New vehicles, new weapons, new maps. Halo 3 is a definite buy for any xbox 360 owner. Of course, if your a die hard Halo fan, you'll want to pick up the legendary version.</comment>

    <title>Not that Satisfying</title>
    <comment>This game is alright. It generates some interest while playing. A lot of good ideas for party games... I didn't like how you can't just click "play again", but instead you have to select it again on the menu. The use of the wii control can be a bit tricky sometimes. There needs to be more of the competition feel in this game. Overall, it's ok. not the best, but a decent game.</comment>

    <title>Still Hilarious</title>
    <comment>I am a big Family Guy fan. I enjoy every single episode that comes out. I would have to say this is a great buy for any Family Guy fan or anyone who loves comedy and needs a good laugh. Family Guy pushes to the limits and sometimes pushes right over them. This 5th season is by far one of the best I would have to say. Family Guy is still hilarious and still growing. A definite buy.</comment>

    <title>Great Movie</title>
    <comment>Gridiron Gang is a feel-good movie. The characters are believable, and the message is one of hope. This is one true story that proves that second chances can be worth the risk.</comment>

    <comment>By far my favorite of Miyazaki's films. A great story with remarkable characters. An incredible soundtrack accompanying beautiful animation. Miyazaki has many amazing movies to his credit, but few with the impact of this one.</comment>

    <title>Excellent movie, beautiful scenery</title>
    <comment>I do not normally care for Tom Cruise movies, but this one is outstanding. It is a wonderful story based on Japan's attempt to modernize in the late 1870s. One cultural mainstay has been the Samurai, their honor code, their wisdom, and the respect they commanded. The advisors to the Emperor convince him all the old ways, especially the Samurai, need to be eliminated. Tom Cruise, a war hero who once fought with Custer, is brought to Japan to teach the Japanese Army the western warfare of guns, cannons, and strategy. In a conflict with a powerful Samurai (Ken Watanbe), Tom Cruise is captured and taken back to the isolated village of the Samurai as a prisoner. It is a rare glimpse into the former Japanese culture, the ways of the Samurai, and how Tom Cruise falls in love with these people and their simple and graceful ways. Ultimately, there is a battle between the new Japanese Army and the last Samurai, with Tom Cruise fighting on the side of the Samurai. You will be mesmerized by the story, the scenery, and the battle scenes. It is now one of my favorite movies and I watch it when I want my spirits lifted. Of course, Blu-Ray makes it all the more beautiful.</comment>

    <title>One of the best seasons of any show this decade</title>
    <comment>Lost may have had its ups and downs later on but this first season was very accomplished and wove suspense and character exposition together in an artful and entertaining way. The commentaries were surprisingly informative and interesting, more revealing about behind the scenes feelings and attitudes than I expected,</comment>

    <title>TERRIBLE</title>
    <comment>I gave this piece of trash one star because I wasn't able to give it zero stars. The first one I picked up charged one of the batteries to full one time, and then the charger completely quit working, so I returned it. The replacement charger seems to work fine, but both of the batteries randomly lose the connection to the controller, so the controller will just shut off while playing. It took me an hour of popping the battery in and out of one of the controllers to get it to come on, but it will just stop working after a while. I'll be taking this back and either buying something made by a different company or a large pack of AA batteries.</comment>

    <title>Great DVD set</title>
    <comment>This isn't just the top comedy show of our era, but it's also a DVD set packed full of goodies. They really gave us fans a lot: Tons of deleted scenes, in most cases over 10 minutes per episode and in most cases as good as what went on the air. Also 8 commentaries. They vary in quality but Jenna Fischer and the writers such as BJ Novak and Jennifer Celotta give informative and entertaining takes on what they thought of scenes. It's a lot of fun.</comment>

    <title>One of the best films of the 90s</title>
    <comment>This movie has the best use of music of any modern movie that I've seen. It's really impressive from the start to the finish. The whole film, which is intelligently written and passionately acted, in the end comes off as a mood piece, and not just the heroic adventure you'd expect. Acting, music, cinematography, all combine to make you feel you are there. If there's a downside, it's that I wish that the young couple in the film had their characters fleshed out more. They could have used more screentime. This movie holds up well. I saw it for the first time in years again a few weeks ago and still loved it.</comment>

    <title>A Great New CSI</title>
    <comment>Although still another version of CSI, CSI: NY is very unique and has many qualities that set it apart from the other well-known CSI and CSI: Miami shows. The first thing that I noticed was that CSI: NY looks much darker and has an NYC feel to it; scenes taking place in the bustling city instead of the desert in Nevada, traffic always backed up, horns honking, and the NYC accent in the characters speech. This season is more dramatic than CSI and CSI:Miami were in their first seasons. The first few episodes too seem less like crime-solving TV and more like a horror movie. Nevertheless, this is a great season and another must buy.</comment>

    <title>one of the better recent horror films</title>
    <comment>ok, so the horror film industry isn't what it used to be. sadly, we keep hoping that a few films will give us hope that the genre may have a ghost's chance of surviving. unfortunately, there are few films to speak of with the exception of anything alejandra aja has made. this being the first film of his to make it's way into theatres in the states, i would say the kid has a promising career. the film takes the old grindhouse/slasher film formula &amp; toys with it's audience for a good half of the film or more. you actually will believe just about everything you see before the twist ending. high tension pull out all the stops &amp; give it's viewer what they are begging for. there is plenty of suspense, brutal violence, &amp; several interesting death scenes. if you love the horror/suspense thriller, you wouldn't want to skip this one. should you enjoy high tension, also check out the hills have eyes remake. surprisingly, aja actually did better this time around than the original wes craven classic.</comment>

    <comment>This antenna did not do much for me and I live on the edge of the city. Perhaps the signal is to weak out here, but I was disappointed with the two channels we were able to receive. I returned it. Not recommended in a suburban setting.</comment>

    <comment>This album continues to build on the success of the first two Grey's Anatomy soundtracks. I love all of the songs on this album and I've already listened to the entire disc several times since buying. This is a great addition to any Grey's or non-Grey's collection.</comment>

    <comment>This is a fast modem! It works so well with comcast! Up to more then starts at 10mbps and up to 100.00! This is one fast modem! It was worth the cash! if you decide to keep unplugging then plugging back in it takes about 5 minutes for service to reach you! Make sure all cord are tightly in from the modem to the jack for the most speeds!</comment>

    <title>Best Of The Best</title>
    <comment>this album definately does not dissapoint if you like kanye you will fall in love with this album as soon as you put it in not only will you like it right away but it just gets better with every single listen. Listening to this cd over and over will never get old its just some of his best work. He has definately come out with the greatest cd of the year and look for this to win the rap album of the year this year because it is by far the best music i have heard come out in the rap game since god knows when. If you have any taste for hip hop r &amp; b or rap you will love this cd definately worth the buy. The best songs are of course Stronger, Can't Tell Me Nothing, Everything I Am, Homecoming, Big Brother not to mention all of the other tracks also just as great but i dont want to name every track. Get This Album.!</comment>

    <title>Upsetting</title>
    <comment>Not his best work. Doesn't Even Compare to Massacre or Get Rich or Die Trying. He has lost his uniqueness now it just sounds like a bunch of threats put together to an ok beat with a chorus from someone who is a better singer than he is. I dont know what he was thinking on this one. Unless you are a die hard 50 fan you will not like this. However if you are a die hard 50 fan go for it you will prolly love it.</comment>

    <title>Could Have Been Better</title>
    <comment>Sonic and the Secret Rings is a good game in all but I think that i really could have been better. If you are a HUGE fan of all the Sonic games then you would probably like this game but if not i really wouldn't reccomend it. If you like fast moving racing games mixed in with a little bit of action then its possible that you would find this to be one of the best games you ever played, but I think it takes a specific taste in games to enjoy a game like this enough to purchase it.</comment>

    <title>Chick flick tats fun for the Guys</title>
    <comment>Like eager kids on their first date, this romantic comedy stumbles and fumbles at times but its heart is definitely in the right place. Sometimes that's just enough. Even though a little less Hitch might have been a better thing, the Fresh Prince keeps the proceedings from becoming too stale.</comment>

    <title>Bset SciFi movie</title>
    <comment>I grew up with the idea that in the future space travel was going to be warp drives, worm holes, aliens and perfectly uniformed crews. This film is a departure from what we have come to expect from SciFi movies. Set about 500 years in the future, the story is about a young girl who's mind has been used in experiments by the Alliance (a Big Brother type government) before being rescued by her brother. They become passengers aboard Serenity, and as a result have placed the crew in danger as the Alliance wants this girl back at any cost. When the dark secret is revealed as to what the Alliance has been up to and why, the crew of this tiny ship takes on a mission to put a stop to their plans. The acting is superb, lots of action, great one liners, and plenty of humor thrown in to keep it from being too dark. This is a movie I could watch time and again. Joss Wheden has created a gem that will endure as one of the best written, directed and acted SciFi films of all time. Buy this for yourself and your friends, and who knows...there could be a sequel!</comment>

    <title>Solid Career Overview</title>
    <comment>This Cd is the perfect starter set for anyone who is looking to get into "Cosmic American Music" as Gram dubbed his work. You get a great selection of works from his time with the short lived International Submarine Band, The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers, and finally some of his best solo work with the Fallen Angels Band (along with wonderful and talented Emmylou Harris). You can get the tracks on other albums, but the packaging here makes a fine addition to any Gram Collection....or a great start of a new collection.</comment>

    <title>Incredible story about a great soccer team</title>
    <comment>My wife and I watched this special when it aired on HBO. It is a great story that follows the core team members through their progression on the National Team up through the historic World Cup victory. You get a great feeling as they move forward through this real life story. This is one item that I will be purchasing on the release date so I can share it with my daughters, both of which play soccer.</comment>

    <comment>The album has mediocre material. 50 is a great artist but this album doesn't have any heat that hasn't already been heard. If you are a 50 fan, you will probably still buy it though.</comment>

    <title>His best effort yet!</title>
    <comment>This is the best album kanye has put together so far. The past 2 were good but if you are ready for a new era in hip hop, it here with this album. No more talking about the regular hip hop garbage. Money, women, drugs, and killing people. This is actually an album where you can listen to it and get away from that. Go pick it up, its an album full of hot beats and hot lyrics (yes i did say lyrics). His lyrical effort are outstanding. Go get it!</comment>

    <title>Thought we would regret it, but we dont</title>
    <comment>We purchased this unit, when it first came-out (about a year ago, or so). Our unit has the key-pad on the side, next to the door, not under it, but it is the Gold G2 technology. I was tired of buying a microwave, only to use it for heating water and cooking popcorn! For the most part, it does what it says. - Awesome for cooking frozen pizza's (sizzle pan) - Awesome for steaming vegetables... using the cooking sensor, it has this "fire &amp; forget" ability so my wife just throws-in the veggie's, in the steamer pan, and press go. No guessing on the time for cooking. They come out perfect each time. - They said it will cook cookies... I thought this load of baloney. Because we had a 30-day return option, we put this baby thru the tests... I was going to take it back if it did not do what they said it would do (too much $$$ fo something that does not perform) It does ACTUALLY cook cookies. Now, the only (so far) down side(s), other than the cost: 1. Make sure you have a dedicated circuit for this baby. When you have both the microwave and the grill light running, this baby is drawing more amp's than PG&amp;E can make! 2. The cooking time for stuff like cookies, grilling burgers... stuff that takes the grill feature can take longer than a normal oven. But if you are like us, we only have room for a single oven/stove top. We don't have the room for one of those double ovens. This unit pretty much takes the place of the double oven, assuming you already have an oven. In closing, I would say that this unit does what they promise and we use it way more than we ever used our old standard microwave. Good luck!</comment>

    <title>Assume nothing</title>
    <comment>This movie is filled with greed, mystery, mistrust, and Love. This is one of my favorite movies because it has many of my favorite actors in it including: Kevin Bacon, Matt Dillion, Neve Cambell, Denise Richards and Bill Murray. In this story Matt Dillion, Neve Cambell and Denise Richards use Love and Deception to gain a fortune but who will ultimately win the battle?</comment>

    <title>Not so great</title>
    <comment>Great look and finish on product but the mounting system is where this product lacks performance. The mounting system is not ideal for the weight that this shelf may hold. If you have a lot of media like I do, you probably want to get something that will be on the ground or risk this product falling off the wall and breaking something or hurting someone. All I put on this was cds and dvds and after the second week the weight and stress was too much for the beam that this shelf is mounted on and it started to thrust itself upward to fall off the beam. If you dont plan on putting a lot of weight (media) on the shelf then it may work for you.</comment>

    <comment>I like this show because its about all the scary things or stories that go around and it gives you an idea what it could be if it was true and that it can be stopped. Plus I think that Jensen Ackles is hot, also liked him in Dark Angel. Special Features include: Unared/Extended scenes, commentarys, Featurettes of Day in the life of Jared and Jensen also Supernatural Tales for the edge of Darkness, Gag reel, gallery, and a DVD-Rom weblink to exclusive online content.</comment>

    <comment>This mount is a good buy. I bought a portable DVD player for my daughter and this mount works great with it. My DVD player is about 10 inches and it fits perfectly in between the seats. I would recommend this for anyone who does not want to mount their portable DVD player to their roof. It is a little wobbly but still does a great job.</comment>

    <title>Jamming</title>
    <comment>This Movie is filled with Jamming sounds and beats. This movie is a Joy to watch from the very beginning. Christopher Reid (Kid) is followed threw out the entire movie buy a group of men (Full Force). But every time the group catches him he escapes. And all the While he is out after Curfew and is being hunted down by his Over Protective Father(Robin Harris). All in all it is well worth the time to sit down with a friend to watch this great classic.</comment>

    <title>Great Office Suite</title>
    <comment>I just bought a new computer in Feb, and wanted the basic Office Suite. Although I was dissapointed that this package did not include Access, the price comparison to the full suite was what drove me to buy this product. Being a home user and not needing business spreadsheets or PPT, I reviewed all the suites they had. For an"end user" like myself, this is the best. Although the menus take awhile to get used to, all the needed functions are available. I would definitely recommend this suite over the others if you're looking for a basic Office Suite without business apps.</comment>

    <title>Greatest Sci-Fi Action Movie Ever</title>
    <comment>You have movies like The Godfather that is arguably model that all other mob movies use as an outline and with Aliens there's not difference. After this movie, more and more Sci-fi movies with aliens combat, outlined their movie after Aliens. This movie is the best of saga, and the director's cut is even better</comment>

    <comment>I purchased this game three days ago after reading all the negative commentary about the new control style this game utilizes. I have to say the gameplay is a bit different using the SIXAXCIS controls but once you get used to them it will be second nature and it DOES NOT EFFECT THE OVERALL GAMEPLAY. I think these comments were written by disgruntal 360 owners or gaming magazines that werent paid off enough to promote the hype...Basically if you can pass all the tutorials in the begining of the game you will be strong enough to beat the game. You just need to anticipate a little more than most typical flying games i.e. start turning before you run into the wall... Overall the graphics are the best I have seen in a consol system with minimal terrian flicker and lag. The cut scenes are movie quality with a great storyline. Being a hardcore gamer I beat the this game with a silver/bronze on every level in a day 14hours but this is expected from a consol of this type...The trick now for me atleast would be to unlock all those secret dragons and get the gold medals which probably will take a little longer...My two cents buy the game probably a little short but the genera/cinematics/graphics make up for it... 4.5/5</comment>

    <title>Fast Pace Basketball Movie</title>
    <comment>Disney has been coming out with great true-life stories, with one of their first, Remember The Titans and now Glory Road that follows Texas Western (UTEP) team through their historic year. If you loved Remember The Titans, than this is a movie to pick up, but be aware that it doesn't give you that emotional feel that Titans did.</comment>

    <title>Funny, and underrated</title>
    <comment>This is the first of two seasons of a very funny comedy on FOX. The show is about a young guy who got a job as an airline executive right out of college. It deals with him trying to find a balance between his work life and social life. Really underrated comedy and FOX didn't really give much thought to promoting it, despite giving it a second season (which it cut the episode count and burned them off during the Summer, after promising a Spring return). This is a cheap buy and won't set you back much to give a try. I think you'll find some good laughs here.</comment>

    <title>Another Classic for Denzel</title>
    <comment>Anything Mr. Washington touches is just golden, and this movie is the same...Gold. Its really hard to believe how a talented actor like Denzel Washington is only nominated for an Oscar when he plays a slave or a bad cop, but for a movie like this he gets nothing. I'm not trying make it a consipracy, but what the does he have to do. This movie just might bring you to tears, to see what these guys go from fighting each other to fighting racism on and off the gridiron.</comment>

    <comment>Ive heard great things about this game. Halo one and two were already great. I cant even imagine how cool this one will be. And by the way right now Best Buy has the best deal. Free shipping and 1600 gamer points for 4.99! I had to pre order right away! This is the best deal i have seen. Check it out for yourself!</comment>

    <title>shuggie rules</title>
    <comment>hands down, this is one of my favorite albums of the seventies which hardly anyone remembers. long before prince made his way into the music industry, shuggie otis was making psychedelic funk/r&amp;b/rock which would've made many heads spin. many of you will probably remember strawberry letter 23 as covered by brothers johnson. while that is certainly an outstanding track even on otis' cd, there are so many other tracks here which are phenomenal examples of what music could be if musicians were a bit serious about their craft. shuggie otis blended several genres together to create the ultimate sonic experience for his listeners &amp; information inspiration still sounds fantastic after all these years. if you love classic seventies music, you deserve to have this in your collection.</comment>

    <title>this is just too cool</title>
    <comment>if you want to impress your cool friends or you simply want something fun to watch, look no further. biozombie is easily the most delightful zomedy right next to shaun of the dead. fans of dawn of the dead or bill &amp; ted's excellent adventure will most likely adore this film. it's funny, it's romantic, &amp; it's even a bit tragic. the film involves two clueless asian teenagers &amp; your typical day in the mall. throughout the course of one day, several unfortunate things will transpire leading up to a flesh hungry zombie attacking/infecting the entire shopping mall. forget the cheesy jacket cover &amp; the b-movie title because this one is truly clever &amp; deserves it's own cult following if it doesn't already have one.</comment>

    <title>funhouse the stooges</title>
    <comment>the stooges second album was a progression forward musically.this album also found them adding the sax to some of their songs and to good effect.the only filler on this album is l.a. blues which is basically just sonic noise.my favorites are down on the street and 1970.recommended to anyone who likes high energy hard rock.</comment>

    <title>Excellent Movie</title>
    <comment>This movie has an excellent story line. It includes a lot of dancing, primarily hip hop and ballet. I personally liked the movie for it's up beat dancing and love story. Also, it focuses on a success story about a young man who is faced with poverty and violence which I find very inspiring. It's an excellent movie for a teenage audience.</comment>

    <title>Ready for launch</title>
    <comment>As soon as the Xbox 360 was launched everyone was waiting for the realease of Halo 3. Ever since playing the pre-release beta I can say the updates make this feel like a whole new challange. The gameplay feels smooth even through all the action that happens throughout the game. Also with new weapons and defenses it now takes more than just brute force to win matches but brains as well. Can't say much about the story line of the game, because it's not out yet, but I sure everyone will love the 4 player co-op opption. if there was ever a reason to sign up for Xbox Live gold now is the time. This title is a must have for the Xbox franchise.</comment>

    <title>Kinda weak - but brings back memories</title>
    <comment>Best way to describe this would be to say it ranks right up there with some of the weakest episodes from the series. We all know the show was the strongest on its story arc/mythology episodes. This movie... essentially 2 episodes.. doesn't have any connection to the mythology. In comparison to today's Battlestar Galactica, its definitely lacking. But as a reminder of the show i once loved, its totally worth it.</comment>

    <title>all-time favorite thriller</title>
    <comment>there is nothing like a good thriller to curl up with &amp; don't look now gets my vote. julei christie &amp; donald sutherland are simply terrific &amp; the films never fails to give me chills down my spine. nicolas roeg struck gold with this lesser known film in my opinion by taking an old du maurier short story &amp; cranking out a full length nightmare. what makes don't look now so incredible is the sense of dread &amp; fear it instill without the use of gore or excessive violence. the atmosphere here is enough to give one bad dreams for days &amp; to even leave paranoid for a few nights. although films like this that have the incredible subdued quality &amp; the twist ending are more popular today, it's a shame more folks didn't latdch on to the one back in the day. thank god for dvd!</comment>

    <title>Never to be Remade</title>

    <title>An Essential Piece</title>
    <comment>This is a great collection. If you like what you've heard but don't have any Tori Amos albums, this collection contains dozens of her best pieces. They have all been digitally remastered for higher quality sound. For people that have a gross collection of Tori Amos albums, this might be a great collector's piece. It's worth only its retail value but it can be fun to hear the slight differences in each track having been remastered. This set also includes two tracks that are not on any other official releases; each track is worth the investment on its own. The track "Mary" is also very rare and worth the investment.</comment>

    <title>TMNT</title>
    <comment>Purchased this for my two grandchildren ages 3 &amp; 5. They can't stop watching it. The youngest thinks he is a turtle and wants to help save the good. This has brought great imagination to their young minds. I would recommend this movie for all young and old. We have also purchased the WII TMNT, after watching the movie, it was a great addition to their gaming collection. They have become a TMNT and are having a great time in their adventures trying to save New York. A lot of action and fun. A great addition to their game collection, they can not sit still while playing the game.</comment>

    <title>best double disc cd ever!</title>
    <comment>notorious b.i.g. was the greatest rapper of all time...period. even though his first album is a classic debut i think that this is his greatest album. both discs are loaded with songs that you can listen to over and over again without having to skip tracks. we really lost out on years worth of good music by this man getting killed and its a shame because hip hop right now is awful.</comment>

    <title>better than 50 cent!!!</title>
    <comment>so i succumbed to their litle publicity stunt where kanye and 50 initiated a friendly rivalry and bought both cd's . I have to say kanye really outdid 50...much more catchy beats and lyrics. 50 uses beats from his last album ..nothing too exciting. i highly recommend GRADUATION.</comment>

    <title>Best Charmed Season</title>
    <comment>Charmed was the longest running series with female leads in television history. This last season is by far and without a doubt the best season. I'm only disappointed that the series had to end, it was doing very well and always had high ratings. The one critiscism I have is at the end of the last episode when Piper is walking back upstairs and the family's pictures are being shown, there weren't any pictures of Pru (Shannon Doerty). I think it would have been better to have shown Pru in the last scenes because she was the oldest and for a time, the more powerful of the sisters. I highly recommed this series to anyone who was a fan of the television show.</comment>

    <comment>This is the funniest show on TV today. The casting is brilliant. Sheen and Cryer are hilarious. Angus T. Jones (Jake) is one of most impressive child actors I've seen.</comment>

    <title>Very Underrated show!</title>
    <comment>For a network show, Supernatural is VERY original and VERY underrated! The second season improves on the excellance of the original, developing the characters and storylines very well. It's a show that also has a great sense of humor along the lines of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer". I highly recommend it! (Especially the episode about the clowns)!</comment>

    <comment>This is a great DVD to watch before or after you watch the DVD The 300. You will be able to see what was true in the movie and what was added for special effects. Yet it is done in the style of the movie so it goes hand in hand.</comment>

    <comment>We don't care for fantasy-type movies so I didn't think my family would enjoy the movie. We were pleasantly surprised because there wasn't much fantasy. We have watched the movie several times. This was a good family movie for both my 13 year old son and 9 year old daughter.</comment>

    <title>What a Movie &amp; its true</title>
    <comment>Besure you also watch the History Channels DVD about the historical look at this battle and how important it was in our current life. This move with all of the special effects is great to watch in HD and surround sound. If you get a chance to watch this in the theater make sure you go, the small screen while pretty good is nothing like watching it in the theater.</comment>

    <title>Very Funny</title>
    <comment>I love watching Sandra Bullock, and Miss Congeniality is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Her transformation from Gracie Hart, ugly duckling FBI agent, to Gracie Lou Freebush, beautiful swan Miss United States pageant contestant is hilarious. Michael Caine's reaction to her appearance when he first sees her is great. He is sure there is no way he can turn her into a feminine woman, especially not in time for the pageant. As a consultant for the pageant, he takes on the challenge, and what he does to her is amazing. The scenes where she is being waxed, pulled, brushed, and improved are funny. You can almost feel her pain! When she exits the airplane hangar, my favorite part occurs when she looks gorgeous then slips and almost falls on her bottom. Benjamin Bratt, as her partner Eric, has a great reaction which I enjoyed. How could he not be infatuated with her after all those changes? When she chants, "You think I'm sexy, you want to date me," I laughed and laughed. I can watch this movie over and over again (and I have) and still laugh at my favorite parts (like when the contestants drank her water for her talent competition, when she dove off the stage onto the man with the gun cigarette lighter... there are too many parts to mention.) The actors were great, the plot was funny, and I think I'll go watch it again right now!</comment>

    <title>One of the Sickest Movies Out There</title>
    <comment>This has got to be the coolest action movie that they have ever made. It has so much action and violence and you won't want to stop watching this once you've started it. Anybody who hasn't seen this i strongly recommend that you see it, instead i recommend you buy it because you're going to want to keep watchin over and over. Those who have seen it know what I'm talking about.</comment>

    <title>Surprisingly Wonderful</title>
    <comment>I've never been a fan of dialogue-free movies, nor was I ever terribly fond of Daft Punk's music. Then I saw Interstella 5555, and my opinion did a total 180. The songs on the Discovery album took on an entirely new life when they were paired with Matsumoto's work, and I've acquired an entirely new appreciation for both. Might not be every person's cup of tea, but if you're into anime and electronic music, this might just be worth your money.</comment>

    <comment>My old HP had 512MB, was not sure about how much I can expand it- so remember to check in the manufacture site and then ask the geak sq as well. Anyway increased it to 2 GB and it running 20 times faster and stronger. This is an expensive upgrade however look over diffrent sites and electronic shops- bestbuy will match any other offer. And the bottom line you get a computer with amazing performance.</comment>

    <title>Good Drama</title>
    <comment>If you're in the mood for a thought provoking drama about religion this is the film for you. This DVD features a very early performance by David Duchovny, and his DVD commentary is quite entertaining. According to the commentary, this movie also made Siskel &amp; Ebert's best of the year list when it was released in theaters.</comment>

    <comment>Possibly one of the best and most significant movies of Jet Li's career comes in this retelling of one of China's greatest legends. It is a story of honor and redemption, filled with beautiful landscapes and impressive martial arts. A must see, not just for fans of Jet Li or martial arts, but for anyone who can appreciate a meaningful story.</comment>

    <title>Small Tripod, Big value</title>
    <comment>This mini tripod is a great complement to a regular tripod.. Great for setting up on a table or something on the fly and extends to about 1ft total. It's built solid and and comes with it's own carrying bag. the base swivels in all directions so getting your shot wont be an issue. A really great buy.</comment>

    <title>Manufacture Defect</title>
    <comment>I carefully selected this Microwave and ordered it though BestBuy. After receiving the shipment, I never got to plug it in. When I put it on the counter and opened the door, I noticed a manufacture's defect. The interior wall was cracked. Best Buy promptly accepted the return, but now, I need to re-order. I will update the review once I obtain a replacement microwave.</comment>

    <title>great quality</title>
    <comment>2 speakers and a sub woofer without reading the details anyone would say its a 2.1 system. But when you buy it or read the detail spec's you find out that its a 5.1. this 3 piece system (not including the remote) gives you so a dynamic range and quality of music. i would recommend this speakers system for any computer owner. Especially the people that watch movie's on there computer i recommend this to you. this system isn't big compared the home theater bose systems but it gives you quality home theater experience on you computer.</comment>

    <title>Great Game</title>
    <comment>This is possibly the best xbox game ever made. Even thought the story was a bit weak, nearly every aspect of Halo 1's game design, graphics, sound, etc. has been improved. The only complaint that I have about it is that the level design took a wrong direction in that the maps were much more confined than halo 1's. This resulted in repetitive playthroughs. Multiplayer, however, was great. I remember playing it like 2-3 hours everyday when it came out.</comment>

    <title>Very Best Addon I ever Purchase!</title>
    <comment>I am a big fan of Sims2 and Since Sims1 came out! Anway's this new Vacation Addon comes allot of stuff in it! It has Hotels, Going on Vacation, Tours, Dig For all cool kind of stuff in the ground! You even get a bonus to download for your game by going to thesims2.com! Before you go on your vaction you must book it like in real life ahead of time before you go. If you do it later date it will be allot cheaper but do it today it will cost your sim more money to go right away. The bad part of the Addon there are some major unnotice bugs in this game but you can't really notice if you have computer that really lags and run very slow. It works on Windows Vista on all edition real well if you are Vista User Bon Voyage should work just fine it work fine for me. You should get this game it is really awesome! When the vacation ends you can choose 3 things when you return your home base they give you forgiveness, happy etc in your memory section. And there is tuns of new turn off's and turn on's! Not going to say to you get the game! Also there is a cheat code let's you build hotels but I want you find that out your self! Anyway's this is all for my review enjoy Bon Voyage if you like camping out doors etc!</comment>

    <comment>I liked this season a lot to, i think that Buffy grows more mature in this season out of all of them. If you don't own the box set of this season then get it for sure, Best Buy's price is so good how can you pass it up!?</comment>

    <title>Monster has Monster Protection</title>
    <comment>Purchased my new HDTV and wanted to protect my investement, so at the suggestion of the Best Buy store rep who said he had the same model I purchased Monster Power Home Theater PowerCenter Surge Protector. It is built solidly and has plenty of connections for cable, TV, DVD player and all the essential components of a "Killer" home theater system. I've used it now for about 4 months and felt totally secure through several thunderboomers with a lot of severe lightening. It has worked great so far. I'm going to buy another one for the the new theater system I'll be putting in our basement finishing project.</comment>

    <title>Nifty radios</title>
    <comment>These are nifty little radios. In thick woods with gradual sloping hills/dirt roads, I got about a quarter mile of clear communications between the two radios. Not bad for 900 Mhz--worked a bit better than I expected. In open farm land, I got a little less that two miles out of them. Again, better than I expected. All in all, these are really nifty. Like a poor man's (me)version of a Motorola DTR550. Can't beat the price.</comment>

    <comment>These Bose speakers have a nice foot print and are stylish compared to others, however the sound quality is a little less than what I expected from a bose product. Sound quality is still very good though. I would recommend the next level up that includes the woofer. For the price there is some great competition out there.</comment>

    <title>One of a kind</title>
    <comment>For those of you who aren't into reality shows or comedies because of their rehearsed or overdone qualities, The Office is an honest, raw blend of both worlds. The Office is a comedy directed "reality show" style, complete with talking heads, cliffhangers, and moments and quotes that stand alone and last forever. This is a must have for any DVD collector. If you're already a fan or you're just experiencing the Office for the first time, this box set is the place to start. The DVD extras are incredible and abundant - special features on every disc - but will still leave you wanting more! The deleted scenes are like episodes in themselves. I must have watched this season 5 times through already and am anxiously awaiting my purchase of Season 3.</comment>

    <title>OUTSTANDING!!!!!</title>
    <comment>I could not be a happier girl right now. I purchased these speakers earlier today to replace a inferior set that came with my computer and had finally blown. A large reason I chose these were the reviews as well as the name Bose. Well...I couldn't resist hooking them to my 42in HDTV flat screen in my bedroom after reading PMACK's review and WOW!!!!! The sound is much crisper, more front sound projection than the TV's built in. Def the Bose signature sound and tone. A HUGE, HUGE improvement, perfect for a smaller place such as the bedroom. Only problem would be once the speakers are in(very easy) you have to control the volume manually from the right speaker. But for me well worth for the Bose sound and for $99. Believe me, try it. And am going back to BB tomorrow for another set for the originally intended computer. BUY THIS!</comment>

    <comment>I was worried when I heard they were going to do an Alien Vs Predator movie. But they did really well on this one. The story moves along pretty well and the effects are excellent. I enjoyed watching the film with the commentary with the director and Lance Henricksen and Sanaa Lathan as well. It was pretty entertaining.</comment>

    <title>Don't miss this performance</title>
    <comment>Ryan Gosling's Oscar nominated performance as a committed inner city history teacher with a drug problem draws you into his world from the first scene. He inhabits the role physically, emotionally, and honestly. The conflict between his daily life trying to help his students see the world beyond their neighborhood and his night life struggling with addiction is believable and gripping. There are no easy answers offered in this film yet it is not a discouraging experience.</comment>

    <title>rock the 80's rocked</title>
    <comment>i thought that this game was the second best of the series so far as far as game play went, but third best as far as songs, especially the first songs. still, its a good buy if you love the series, but should probably wait for guitar hero 3 or get guitar hero 2 first if you dont own any of the series yet.</comment>

    <title>Greatest Xbox game</title>
    <comment>This game hands down was the best game out for the original Xbox. If you still have an Xbox and cannot afford the Xbox 360, I recommend this game. It won't be as big as it was though with the release of Halo 3. Once again, incredible game.</comment>

    <comment>i got this game after guitar hero 2 and rock the 80's, so i don't know if that affects my review, but i thought it was still pretty good. the songs in this one were probably the best, but the gameplay wasn't as good as the others. this one's probably best if you get it first, but still not bad.</comment>

    <title>The latest from the Newsboys!</title>
    <comment>Another great album by the newsboys! Instead of being a pure worship album like Adoration and Devotion, this album has more of a secular feel to it (like many of their other albums). Personal favorites include "Your Love Is Better Than Life", "Mission", and "Something Beautiful." Note, this is the last album with Phil Joel. :(</comment>

    <title>greatest of series so far</title>
    <comment>this is an awesome game. so far, it is the best of the series with a great soundtrack and better gameplay than the first. Also, the new co-op gameplay and face-off two player options are great for more than one person. For me, this game offers hours and hours of gameplay and always leaves me with something more to do.</comment>

    <comment>Great Movie with great special effects. The only thing that was kinda stupid was the relationship he develops with his old dead friends wife; Kinda random and slowed the plot down a little, but overall a wonderful movie!!</comment>

    <title>What a Surprise!</title>
    <comment>I was all set to hate this cd when it came out. Why tamper with the songs that I've listened to and loved for years? But I have to admit, one play and I was hooked! George Martin definately hasn't lost his ear or his touch for producing the Beatles. One of the best things about this cd is how songs are layered in spots, one song over and/or leading into another, yet it still sounds sensational. Familiar, yet like nothing we've ever heard from the Beatles before. Definately worth purchasing for any Beatles fan, or anyone that just appreciates classic rock with a twist.</comment>

    <title>He's Back</title>
    <comment>The Docter is back, and hes great. I've been a long time fan of Doctor Who, and while this new series has a different vibe than the original, it's still great. The humor and charm are still there, and the effects are so much better!! Plus the DVDs and Doctor Who Confidential. A whole behind the scenes series!</comment>

    <title>This album beats "Curtis" hands down!!!</title>
    <comment>When the single "Cant tell me nothing" came out I already knew who won. Kanye West calloborates with different artists from different genre's thats why his fanbase is big. 50 cent talks about the same things like his other albums, "The game" is a better artist than him. Overall this album is great 5 stars all the way. Get this album if you like Rock, Pop, Rap, Techno, he has it all.</comment>

    <title>Awesome</title>
    <comment>Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an outstanding social commentary on the trials and tribulations of the youths of today. It is still relevant and has a way of really sucking you in (pun intended). You can't really ask for a more self aware show that readily pokes fun at itself. I found the joy of Buffy a couple of years ago and I am now hooked. I wold highly recommend this series to anyone who likes romance, suspense, sci-fi, action and comedy genres. It has it all.</comment>

    <title>Coen Brothers' best</title>
    <comment>This is my favorite Coen Brothers movie, it all comes together: music, acting, a fun story. This is also the movie that made me finally grudgingly respect George Clooney as an actor. He really threw himself into the role, he wasn't just gliding through it trying to look handsome. Great ensemble work with Tim Blake Nelson being the standout among hte supporting cast.</comment>

    <title>Only for fans...</title>
    <comment>Well this game is best described as cliche'. If you are a casual gamer trying new things I would suggest to walk away from this game, its too complicated. But that been said: to the fans of stragedy games this is a nice pick that will hold you over till the most awaited "Final Fantasy Tactics" hits the psp. I wish that was it but sadly what MUST be said is that this game although it comes wrapped in a great presentation and hooks you with its anime background, just doesn't handle well. I have an easier time with my two year little girl in toys r us than trying to tell my charaters who to attack or much less what to do. It's all stylus or a weird grid navigation that leaves you frustated. The stylus didn't always do what i wanted (picking a monster right in front of me to attack), and the non-stylus option just felt like an unfinished option. Overall its just a diversion until the triple-A titles hit later this year, but not much else.</comment>

    <title>Router resets itself, No range increase</title>
    <comment>Had this for a day, returned it because product was defective. The router kept on resetting itself. Pros: Attractive, D-link continues to upgrade firmware vigorously. Cons: Failed within 3 hours of use for me - router resets itself, my range did not increase (I live downtown Chicago in a building with a lot of steel), this router is 2.4Ghz ONLY - if you are looking for N in the 5Ghz range, try Buffalo or Apple Airport Extreme.</comment>

    <title>Just keeps getting Better</title>
    <comment>The story is developing very nicely and is getting complex. I always tend to enjoy stories based upon taping into human potential and this one is getting deeper. Season 3 on DVD helped me since I missed a few of the episodes to fill in a few gaps and was well worth the purchase price. Would I recommend this to a friend - I bought it for a friend it is that good!</comment>

    <title>GREAT!!!</title>
    <comment>This is one of the best shooter games out on the market. The XBox 360 version is spectacular. The multi-player is far and above any other game that I possess. I highly recommend this game for all gamer types. The controls are quite simple to learn, and the online gaming is easy to navigate through. Rainbow Six Vegas offers quite a few different maps and a good number of game types. The ranking system is great and fairly simple to fly through the bottom ranks. Go get this game now!!!</comment>

    <comment>Wow, I haven't laughed as hard as I did watching this movie since "The Adventures of Pluto Nash". Eddie Murphey is at his usual hilarious self as Norbit the guy who cant seem to catch a break. Not only is Eddie in the movie but also Cuba Gooding jr., wow again best work since snow dogs (im not counting Daddy Day Camp since i haven't seen it). so if big laughs are what you're looking for you will find in Norbit, peep it!</comment>

    <title>Easy to Setup and Use</title>
    <comment>I bought this switch so I could easily transfer files at high speeds, and it does exactly that! The only flaw I found is I couldn't connect a DSL modem into it because my internet wouldn't come up, but through a wireless router this is the best thing you could buy for your network. Just make sure you have a gigabit NIC before you buy it, or you won't be able to fully utilize it's features.</comment>

    <title>A Grand Finale</title>
    <comment>I've watched Charmed since its humble beginnings, watching them claimed their powers, in their quest to live a normal lives and served the greater good. I am sad that it has to come to an end, but like most great shows, it's best to exit while it is still memorable. I do think they should mentioned Pru (Shannon Doherty) in the last season. After all, she was one of the original Charmed ones. To grief her loss for so long and finally forgoten about her in the end is surprising to me. Regardless, get this copy, and relive the magic that Charmed Ones has brought upon us!</comment>

    <title>very easy to install</title>
    <comment>It was incredibly easy to install and within a few minutes the tivo had downloaded all the information. It is wonderful not having to use the phone line and knowing that all my program information is there and that I can now have the choice of enjoying all the other benefits that tivo offers.</comment>

    <comment>This game is a great game!, it gives you total freedom with great gameplay and excellent controls. I'm a big time fan of rpgs but this one just blows the others into bits. This is a great game for airplane rides, long car trips and other long and boring situations. Not only do i recommend this to a friend but i strongly suggest this game to any person who is in the mood for a grab and go game</comment>

    <title>Fun and you work up a sweat</title>
    <comment>I orginally got the videos through netflix to try them out. I thought it would might give me a work out and teach me something to spice up the marriage. I couldn't believe I was actually sweating. I wouldn't say I pick up routine's quickly but Carmen made it easy. I actually recommended this series to all of my friends.</comment>

    <title>Best Season</title>
    <comment>This season was a highlight for Enterprise and Star Trek as a whole. Manny Coto (of 24 fame) did a great job turning the show around. It is too bad the show was canceled after this season, because there were SO many ways they could have gone, and would have gone. Get this season if you enjoy Star Trek</comment>

    <title>Excellent investment</title>
    <comment>This Air Purifier is an excellent investment, and enabled me to sleep peacefully without having to deal with allergy symptoms the entire night. The Honeywell 99% HEPA Tower Air Purifier with Ionizer and Permanent Filter has been a terrific investment since I bought it. The only thing that could be different about it is an oscillating feature. Another feature that would be quite useful is a remote control for the tower. The remote would enable a person to change the settings without having to get up. Even without those two features that would have improved it much more, the product itself is wonderful. I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from allergies. It's not too loud to sleep with in the room either. It's simply the best investment I have ever made.</comment>

    <comment>This has to be one of the best sci-fi shows ever made... and Fox canned it :( It has a rewatchability that is second to none. I discovered this show after it was on DVD, and I've loved it ever since -- John Wayne in space couldn't be any better than this :D</comment>

    <title>Blast</title>
    <comment>Last Man Standing is an all out gunfight from beginning to end. It is based in the 1940's where the Tommy Guns where the Rulers of the Streets. Bruce Willis (John Smith) has a pair of .45 caliber pistols that he uses threw out the entire movie to put his point across. And of course there is a woman that he is trying to free. This movie is a great addition to any movie archive.</comment>

    <comment>Lord of war is an action packed comedy mixed in with some drama. This is a movie about a young man that has dreams of making a lot of money. His first sale was a pair of Israeli made Uzi's which he almost died from, but with a bit of humor saved his life. In the end he has a chance to keep from losing everything. But will he take it?</comment>

    <comment>What an excellently done movie. Spectacular special effects drawing on many elements from the books to create a flowing storyline that leaves one laughing hysterically, and yet at the same time considering the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. Wish they would make more of these.</comment>

    <comment>This is game is hopefully going to be awesome! I 2 have been following smbb and I like what i see. The new rendered textures look great, and how they use the same clothing on characters from their original games is great 2! I am not so sure how the final smash thing will work out, i.e. how often it would drop, and etc... But, the customization option looks better than ever and i cant' wait! And, ice climbers IS back. If anyone wants to check it out, heres is the link for the official site: http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/index.html</comment>

    <title>Finally, in the format it deserves!</title>
    <comment>The most complete version of William Shakespeare's Hamlet to ever be put to film is finally on DVD, and it has never looked more stunning. This film was even hard to find on VHS after its theatrical run. The mere scope of the project lends itself in such a complimentary way to wide screen TV's But the fact that this is on DVD is such a small part of the treat. The cast of this film are of such a fantastic caliber, they deliver their performance in such a way, it is as though they are staging the play live on an epic set of the grandest scale. Kenneth Branagh has chosen to deliver the character with only an underlying sense of tragedy, but not disclosing his melancholy to those he doesn't trust. He instead puts on a multidimensional character that seems to have gone completely mad from the grief of his father's passing, and his mother quickly marrying his uncle, thus making his performance passionate, and even many times comedic. Branagh sees that the best way to deliver a Shakespearean play is to deliver a tragedy comically, and deliver a comedic play tragically. I am proud to finally own this film on DVD. A+</comment>

    <title>Great Comedy Fun on FOX</title>
    <comment>FOX made a good decision to put Family Guy back on the air. The slapstick comedy, one-liners, and gags are as funny as they've always been. I give Seth MacFarlane credit for putting up with a lot of negative criticism from South Park creators and probably some from die-hard Simpsons fans. But at the end of the day they're all driving towards the same goal. Making us laugh as much as they can. Some of my favorite episodes of this season are "Stewie Loves Lois, Saving Private Brian, &amp; Road to Rupert, I'll bet this show continues on for many years. Here's to you Seth! Keep up the great work!</comment>

The game has many new and interesting mini games that keep you on your toes. It is also really nice because little kids can play it as well and the movements are slow and simple. Overall this game is a must and you wont regret it.</comment>

    <title>Two Words ain't the best</title>
    <comment>Well, the game was compared to one of the BEST RPGs of all time. Does it stack up? No, its a good distraction, but with all the great games coming out, I'd pass on this one. The storyline it self takes maybe 8 hours max. The side quests are numerous but not very enjoyable. I did put in about 22 hours in this game, but after that, I doubt I will ever replay it. This is a rental at best. Graphics are alright, but not up to today standards, the voice acting is one worth PATHETIC. Multiplayer has no Servers, so the host better have a nice connection. I run a 9MB connection and when I hosted a 2 player match, the lag was still HORRIBLE&gt;</comment>

    <title>Great Album</title>
    <comment>This album is even better than their previous one. Some songs are not as great as others, but there are a few really great ones that you can listen to over and over such as 505, balaclava, and fluorescent adolescence.</comment>

    <title>Not a Waste</title>
    <comment>Waist Deep is a classic get the bad guys and save your son movie. O2(Tyrese Gibson) just got out of jail and he picks his son up form school and he gets car jacked. From that point on its all or nothing. This is a good movie to watch on a Sunday after noon when you really need something thats going to distract you from the usual Sunday boredom.</comment>

    <title>this one is on my list</title>
    <comment>man push cart look great. i think that it looks like children of men in the way it was shot. the DP did a good job on this one. the shots look to be dynamic and genuine. i wanted to make it out to see this one in the theatre but missed it somehow. i'll be sure to pick up this dvd on 10-9-07. i don't think my local springfield store will carry this item due to lack of diversity in their selection. see- Interview directed by Steve Buscemi</comment>

    <comment>This DVD DBZ box set is simply the best way to watch Dragon Ball Z. The rerecorded voices are better than the old ones, and this is a great deal on all of the episodes instead of the old $15 bucks for 3-4 episodes. Now you get all of the episodes for around 30. Buy it if you like DBZ.</comment>

    <title>BEST PURCHASE EVER</title>
    <comment>This is definately one of Jay-Z's best albums ever made. It combines street lyrics with a jazzy best feel to it. It has changed rap and taken it to a whole new level, and also opened the doors for many new artists such as Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco and many others. BUY THIS ALBUM if you wanna hear REAL HIP-HOP</comment>

    <title>Dvd cases need work</title>
    <comment>Overall, these cases are ok, but they seem to rip where you insert the paper insert. I use card stock and out of 10 cases, about 3 seem to rip every time thus wasted to use for my customers. Memorex is by far the best, but hard to find here online.. If you're desperate, these will work ok..</comment>

    <title>a must have title</title>
    <comment>taxi driver is not only my favorite De Niro and Scorsese film, it's a film of passion and loyalty to one's dream. this film has a mellow feel with a steady pulse, ready to snap. every actors preformances were great. this film is one of a kind but has film noir overtones that captivate your soul. i believe this to be Martin Scorsese's masterpiece work! you can count the wonderful quotes: "all my life needed was a sense of some place to go." " i don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention." " i believe one should become a person, like other people." and the most popular, "you talkin' to me.. you talkin' to me... well, i'm the only one here." this film is in my top ten films of all time! the only things i don't like on the dvd is that there is no trailer for taxi driver and the aspect ratio is 1.85:1 instead of 2.35:1. i like the true widescreen format.</comment>

    <title>a cult classic</title>
    <comment>this film was Produced by quentin tarantino and of course has a cult following, to only a few, where i come from. this is a must see for fans of tarantino. if you are offended by crude films, you might not like this(not for the kiddies). it kinda has that tarantino feel to it. a lot of the film is in french with subtitles and some is in english. this film has a good soundtrack. i'm suprised that they haven't made an anniversery edition with a lot of features and the soundtrack cd in a 3 disk set! idea?</comment>

    <title>Best Used As A Coaster</title>
    <comment>I love anime. It is really hard for me to find a title that I don't like. There are ones that I find to be okay, but that's usually about the worst it gets. This anime, however, has managed to be so disappointing that I could only watch two episodes before I shut off the TV. I still haven't watched the rest of it, despite the fact that I paid good money for it (and I always at the very least try to finish watching something if I buy it). Who knows, maybe it got better in the final two episodes on the disc, but I wasn't about to sit down and find out. Note: maybe I would recommend it to children who were misbehaving.....</comment>

    <title>Phenomenal Product</title>
    <comment>This item is a must buy for consumers looking for a quality home theater system. No home theater system is complete without a power center. I learned about this product while doing preliminary research after a Bestbuy associate informed me of the existence of a product that can enhance my overall home theater experience. Best purchase ever in regards to home theater equipment! Yes, this product will save your equipment from surges and fluctuating electric currents. However I am most impressed with what most people don't know. Unparallel picture quality! I though my Full 1080 HD picture was good with a standard power strip. Was I ever wrong. After purchasing the power center the picture quality tripled and my picture is immaculate. Phenomenal sound! When connecting my receiver and sub to the power center I was instantly impressed by the sharper and crisper sound. Now I have a superior product and have had two close friends purchase the same item with the exact same results. If a quality home theater system is what you are looking for the addition of this power center is essential. The color coded equipment power outlets make for easy installment. User friendly, and 100% satisfying. I highly recommend this purchase.</comment>

    <title>War Classic</title>
    <comment>Full metal Jacket is A Vietnam war classic. It shows the Training and the Things the soldiers had to under go. I would not recommend this movie for anyone below the age of 12, because some parts are extremely bloody. But i really enjoyed watching this movie, I would recommend this movie to everyone that likes to watch war films.</comment>

    <title>Impressive Quality, Inspiring Film</title>
    <comment>Everyone knows the story of the three hundred at Thermopylae, so I'll skip to the features. I bought this to be used on the PS3 with HD cables and the quality versus standard DVD is impressive. The colors are vibrant and bold, and the sharpness of each image is precise. The in-movie menu is easily accessible and navigable, ibcluding features on the training regimen and the actors. I recommend this title and have yet to be disappointed with Blu-Ray.</comment>

    <title>Project 8 good outing</title>
    <comment>Tony Hawk's Project 8 was by far the best game in the series yet. The arge envirnonment with a consistant background made the game flow and the graphics were significantly better than any of the previous releases. However, as the game went on the goals became quite repetative. This is nothing new in Tony Hawk games, but it leaves something to be desired. If the franchise moed out of their comfort zone and experimented I feel the game could become truly superior. A feature that I enjoyed was the focus/nail-the-trick feature. It made skating more real with the ability to move the individual feet. This brought more realism to the game and I enjoyed the level of control that it brought.</comment>

    <title>Better than curtis</title>
    <comment>this album is definetely better than curtis. curtis is a wanna be gangsta album with no real thought put in. the beats are amazing and easy to listen to. his lyrics feel like theirs emotion put in and not in a monotonous tone like 50 cents. the way 50 flows is boring and you can begin to forget your listening to him. Graduation is a must buy.</comment>

    <title>A Masterpiece Of Filmmaking. Olivier's Greatest.</title>
    <comment>Sir Laurence Olivier directs, produces, co-writes and stars in this critically acclaimed film version of William Shakespeare's greatest tragedy. For years, there have been countless interpretations of the Bard's sumptuous work of love, revenge, family loyalty and betrayal. Olivier does the Bard justice in this 2/1/2 hour masterpiece. While cutting some of Hamlet's soliloquies ("How all occasions do inform against me, and spur my dull revenge...," etc) and other famous lines ("O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown...," etc), completely eliminating Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Fortinbras, Cornelius and Voltimand, Olivier nevertheless retains the central aspect of the play: Hamlet and the darkness surrounding him after his father's death. Well-done. This film is an excellent alternative for those who find Kenneth Branagh's excellent 4 hour version too long. Personally, I think both are well-filmed interpretations. Skip Zeferelli's and enjoy the Masters Of Shakespeare: Sir Laurence Olivier &amp; Kenneth Branagh.</comment>

    <title>Ridiculously Funny Show</title>
    <comment>Rick &amp; Steve is Logo's newest comedy and you will be laughing. Generally aimed at the LGBT audience, this show provides a mix of crude humor and modern social satire that will bring you to your knees laughing. The 'lego' like animation only adds to the ridiculousness. The kitty demands you buy this DVD!</comment>

    <comment>I bought this game when I bought my Wii. The gameplay is a little challenging and sometimes the camera angle can be frustrating. But the story line and action are really good and I would recommend getting this game.</comment>

    <comment>If you like the .hack series I guess you would like this one. I bought it because a friend told me it was good. I got to the fourth episode and stopped. Now I own it but have no will to watch it. It is to slow, I would not recommend this item. I would recommend .hack//roots, it is better, but not the best anime I have seen.</comment>

    <title>Justice For All</title>
    <comment>These two DVD were the last of the series, running about five seasons long &amp; ending with a big bang! Although there was a name change to the last season, from the old justice league which had only Superman, Batman, Wonder woman, the green alien, The Green Lantern, Hawk girl &amp; flash to Justice League Unlimited. Accompanied by new hero's &amp; well alot of new stuff(spaceships, tools, cars, training rooms, etc.) as well as old villains &amp; new surprises to be sure! If your a fan of super hero's &amp; you like or read comics i would recommend buying this DVD!</comment>

    <title>Justice Not Just An Idea!</title>
    <comment>Jsutice League Unlimited vol.1 was not just the start of the end of the series but a new being for the super hero era, adding to the roster of the last seasons character list are new hero's like Buster Gold or The Question, Green Arrow, Black Canary, Supergirl &amp; many, many more! This is one of the best series out today 7 i would recommend buying it if your into super hero's &amp; comic books!</comment>

Superman shows his true strength, Lex's is going mad, Monks spirits are stolen, The ant-life equation is found &amp; deals are made! This is the end days of the justice league series, buy it to find out what happens to the DC Universe &amp; all it's hero's!!!</comment>

    <comment>Connie and Carla is a cute, fun movie. You don't have to like musicals to enjoy this film. It also doesn't hurt that David Duchovny is in it. Don't worry, he doesn't sing. If you're in the mood for a romantic comedy this is the DVD for you.</comment>

    <title>Great wireless controller</title>
    <comment>Pros: * Ergonomics were well thought out * Removable battery packs * Perfect button layout (IMHO) * Very easliy connects wirelessly to xbox 360 Cons: * A little on the heavy side (especially after hours of play) * D-pad is sub-par making some XBL arcade games difficult Not like there's an wide variety of controller options out there but I would highly prefer these controllers over controllers from competitive systems</comment>

    <title>Love it</title>
    <comment>I absolutely recommend this to any one who has friends whether on XBL or MSN messenger. It was such a nuisance using the display keyboard and plugging in a USB keyboard was a pain. The unit connects flawlessly to your existing xbox 360 controller and it is easy to switch between messaging and gaming. My only irritant would be that this is not compatible with my existing wired headsets.</comment>

    <title>Graphically Pleasing</title>
    <comment>This movie was fun to watch. The CGI was amazing and the acting was top notch (although the ascents seemed weird). This is a very close adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel, would a few things added to make the story more fleshed out. The DVD is great, although I'd recommend the HD version more, so you can see the movie in it's full glory.</comment>

    <title>Unexpected fun!</title>
    <comment>Mars Attacks is loads of fun! Not your typical Tim Burton film, and certainly not like every other sci-fi B-movie. A definite must-see. A-list cast fill the credits of this film, and an amazing score from none other than Danny Elfman. Don't listen to Roger Ebert on this one- enough time has passed since 1996 to make this one a classic. Everyone will love it. I promise.</comment>

    <comment>This is a game for anyone that has ever rocked out to a song and played the air guitar, which is most likely every person on the planet. Truly a game that will last hours and hours even if you have played the previous installment. It really makes you feel like you are on stage playing world famous covers, the lights, the cameras, the action, unbelievable. I recommend this intuitive game to anyone and everyone.</comment>

    <comment>Family Guy Volume 4 is the best installment yet of the series. Some features include commentary on every episode by those associated with the show, scene studies, deleted scenes, featurettes, and DVD-ROM link to exclusive online content. This fourteen episode, three disc set is sure to pack in the laughs, and is a must have for lovers of comedy.</comment>

    <title>Amazing Series</title>
    <comment>This is the best vampire movie/tv show made. It is unfortunate it only went through one season, which I think it due to poor advertising and being on Spike, which personally I never watched before/after Blade. Better than the movies. Love Sticky as Blade.</comment>

    <comment>Following the steps of the n64 and gamecube, this game is great for the family, or a buncha friends. There are more interesting mini games, some frustrating, others comical. Great game though meant for children, can involve adults as well. Enjoy!</comment>

    <comment>Guitar Hero encore Rocks N 80s gives you exactly what it says in the title even more of your favorite songs from the 80s. Despite not having bonus tracks like the previous games it is worth the money to play the featured songs.</comment>

    <title>Listen to the Universe</title>
    <comment>I saw this movie on Saturday September 15th and immediately pre-ordered the Best Buy exclusive which has all the songs from this movie. This movie and these songs enthralled me from the first note to the last beat of the music. I am a fan of the Beatles and to hear some of my favorite songs brought to life in this movie was something I never thought I would see again without popping in a dvd of Yellow Submarine or any other Beatles movie. All of the singers on this cd can sing and Evan Rachel Wood was a surprise - who knew she could sing!! Dana Fuchs who plays Sadie might as well be Janis Joplin as she chanels every throaty growl she has into each song. I can't rave about this enough-see this movie, buy the exclusive and get the dvd when it comes out months from noe</comment>

    <title>Highly Recommended</title>
    <comment>I would definitely recommend this DVD set. While it isn't filled with many special features or anything fancy, it is exactly what it looks like: a compilation of all the episodes of Season 4 of Dawson's Creek, a cheesy teen drama that is incredibly addicting and entertaining. The only downside is that the theme song that opens each episode is changed for reasons I am unaware of. All in all, I'd say this is a wonderful investment, and a great way to fill up your spare time.</comment>

    <title>Great Show~</title>
    <comment>I loved this show when it was originally on UPN, and was very glad that they released the first season on DVD. It's basically a cop show with a bit of a sci-fi element: a police detective must control and use his hyperactive senses to help him solve cases. I though the show was extremely interesting and well-written. Though there are no special features, the episodes are good quality and I sincerely hope they will put out the second and third seasons, though it's been at least a year or two since the first season was released so I am (sadly) a bit wary.</comment>

    <comment>Easily one of the most anticipated games this year, Halo 3 is unlikely to disappoint any harcore gamer's need for some Master Chief action. With Microsoft's avd marketing, no gamer should miss out on the final installment in the Halo trilogy. This is a no brainer!</comment>

    <title>Well built surge protector</title>
    <comment>It's kind of hard to get excited about a surge protector. I was going to get a power center but came across this surge protector. It does about the same as a low end power center and not as expensive and half the size.. you get the the LED voltage readout and the outlets are spaced far enough apart so you can use every plug. also you will be able to know which cord is for which device because the oulets are labeled and it comes with color coded labels for the cords. I was able to hide this neatly behind my TV stand.</comment>

    <title>An Instant Classic</title>
    <comment>"Knocked Up" is one of the funniest and well made comedies of all time. Because it was released a couple of months before the amazing "Superbad" (made by the same crew that creat "Knocked Up") it was a little over-shadowed, but this one might be as good. It doesn't have as many 'laughs-per-minute' as "Superbad" but it has a more complex and emotional plot, which makes it the slighty superior movie. Knocked Up is definitely on of the best 10 comedies of all time.</comment>

    <title>Awesome bag</title>
    <comment>I recently purchased a Canon Powershot camera (A570) and needed a carrying bag to put it in, so I checked lowepro's site to match my camera to the right bag and picked this one up at my local BestBuy. The bag is built really well, it's weather proof, my camera fits perfect inside (which is lined with very soft material), It has a Velcro flap that can store your extra batteries perfectly and the outside of that flap has a small pocket (zipper) to hold your extra memory cards! It's everything you could want for such a low price, it also comes with a should/neck strap as well. Once again, a true best buy.</comment>

    <title>Outstanding All-Around Solution</title>
    <comment>I am quite pleased that the Best Buy I went in to was sold out of the 3-speaker set from another reputable company I had originally gone in to buy. Being from Bose, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that these speakers offer an amazing amount of bass without the clutter or hassle of a subwoofer. I probably could have gotten more bass from a subwoofer set, but living in an apartment, I couldn't really use any more bass than these speakers put out without disturbing my neighbors, anyway. The additional input jacks are great too, especially since a cable for connecting to a DVD player/TV etc. is included. Plus, they're a great deal cheaper than most products with the Bose name; less than a third of the cost of the next model up the Bose PC-speaker product line. Bottom line, these speakers are a great all-around solution for many uses from PCs to portable DVD players to adding some extra oomph to your older/smaller TV. Great buy.</comment>

    <title>not ideal for use in bed</title>
    <comment>these headphones oddly enough, don't work with the newer sony tv that I have - they only work with the older model. They don't fit on the charger extremely well - they tend to slip off. My only other complaint is that you have to be completely sitting up to use them, they are not meant to be used as headphones for you to use while your spouse sleeps.</comment>

    <title>Best foreign film of the decade</title>
    <comment>Better than Amelie. Although that's far from a unanimous consensus, it is how I felt after seeing this film. I loved it in a way I love few foreign language movies. It's a real epic, and a real story, full of side stories along the way and a very satisfying and believable resolution. The beginning was a little iffy, I thought at first I'd made a mistake watching it, but get past the first 15 minutes and you will likely love it.</comment>

    <title>My kids Love this game!</title>
    <comment>My kids love playing this game! It's action-packed, exciting and keeps them interested with challenging terrain to negotiate (i.e; flying THROUGH the eye of the Eiffel Tower to chase your mark). It's classic good vs evil...(read: the violence is not gratuitous) . It even sparked an interest in history due to the WWII setting. All the kids at the local teen clubhouse are really into it and willingly wait in line for their chance to play. Your kids will love it too!</comment>

    <title>Worth every penny</title>
    <comment>This show was recommended to me, so I took a shot and bought it, and it was worth every penny I paid! Smart, funny, sometimes outrageous, sometimes subtle, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer's journey into TV raises the bar for TV sit com's. Focusing on the Bluth Family and how they had and lost it all, the show is shot in a unique documentary style unlike anything you normally would see on TV. If your comedy tastes run along shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm, Mr. Show or The Office, you will definitely enjoy this!</comment>

    <title>What Was That</title>
    <comment>I like Tyrese, but how many thuggish movies are you gonna do until you realize that you are not a thug. Waist Deep is another reason why some singers should just stay at what they do best, sing on the soundtrack. A surprise was The Game. He was great as gangster, but fell off as an actor.</comment>

    <title>Great for home networks!!!</title>
    <comment>I bought a bunch of these for home network installs I'm doing. A great deal at the $50 I picked it up for a couple weeks ago. The installation couldn't be easier. Plug the adaptor into the wall. Plug the other end into the switch. Plug in the cable from your modem or router (any port works, there's no WAN port like on your typical consumer grade 4 port router). Plug in your devices, i.e. computer, mp3 streaming device, etc. This is great for home networks sharing an internet connection and only so-so for large file transfers like if you have a Network Attached Storage device. That's it! You're done, you get full duplex connections and a lifetime warranty on it (Netgear recently upgraded the warranty to lifetime for all Prosafe products.) Built well, a little heavy, and it wallmounts in three directions.</comment>

    <comment>Two hours of a movie that could have been summed up in a two minute video. Curtis needs to stick to rappin', but lately he hasn't been doing a good job at that either. Well have fun at the energy drink thing, because as a rapper and actor its gonna take up alot of energy...I know that was corny</comment>

    <title>Very Well-Designed</title>
    <comment>I had to get a velcro replacement for my Blackberry 7290 because the hard case that came with it was terrible. I am very active - chosing to run up three flights of stairs instead of taking the elevator. The phone kept falling out whenever I bent over or barely bumped it. When I got my new Blackberry 8830, I went ahead and got this new leather case with the very convenient magnetic flap. It's great! My new Blackberry never falls out! Getting my BB in and out of the case is a snap! No loud velcro ripping noises - nice and quiet! The magnetic flap "pops" into place without sticking to my clothes.</comment>

    <title>A Will Story</title>
    <comment>A funny movie that sometimes goes a little bit overboard on the humor, but if you liked Anchorman, than this is the norm. Will Ferrell is doing the same thing Adam Sandler did in the late 90s, after leaving SNL and making funny cult-like movies. So enjoy, and say your prayers to little sweet Baby Jesus</comment>

    <title>Great Album</title>
    <comment>This albums is a must for any fans of hiphop. Kanye fell off a bit on his sophomore debut, but he triumphantly returns to his origins on this album. Even if he wasnt rapping the production on this album is easily the best this year. Also there are notable cameos from mos def, dj premier, lil wayne. A must for music lovers.</comment>

    <title>Fun and entertaining for trivia buffs</title>
    <comment>I received this game as a gift and enjoyed it each time I play. This follows the same concept of moving your game piece around the board after you successfully answer questions on the DVD. Very interactive; great to play in teams or family settings. Perfect for movie buffs.</comment>

    <title>Who doesn't love this movie</title>
    <comment>If you're over 30 you'll love reliving these times. Frank, Brad, Janet, Raff and of course Rocky. The "prompting" is really fun and we all know all the songs by heart. Do youself a favor and buy this classic so you can go back in time whenever you want.</comment>

    <comment>This is both a tragic and heroic story of deception, cruelty, love and redemption. A must-see film about totalitarian states, paranoia, and repression.</comment>

    <title>Absolutely amazing!</title>
    <comment>This CD will blow you away. There isn't any "new" material here, per se, it is the way that George Martin and his son produce and arrange it. They string together past Beatle songs together as they've never been done before. In some instances there are 3 and 4 portions of songs laid directly on top of each other. The result is beyond words.</comment>

    <title>Underwhelming</title>
    <comment>We purchased this one to update the older D-Link router we had, which worked fine, but didn't provide the "n" needed for my son's Nintendo wireless needs. It has proven less reliable than the earlier version, with my signal coming and going continuously. I can't say if it's all the fault of the router as opposed to my cable, but I didn't have near these problems with the older version. Support from D-Link is pretty good (they were responsive and tried many things), but they couldn't fix my problem. I might go back and install the old one...</comment>

    <title>Works Great</title>
    <comment>have always been very comfortable using PNY memory in my notebook computers and this installation just strengthens my belief that PNY is a great manufacturer. The installation was easy as usual and I had no issues with the notebook recognizing the SODIMM. I will definitely keep my eyes our for a great deal on another PNY 1gb SODIMM in the future.</comment>

    <title>the hype</title>
    <comment>Kanye and 50 Cent made a smart move by insinuating a battle over who was best. I admit, I fell into the trap and had to rush out and buy Kanye's album to show my support. I gotta say the album in not nearly as good as Kanye's previous albums, so don't be expecting anything up to that caliber. It's weird, nothing jumps out at you but is certainly worth a listen. Don't get me wrong, I like the album but we've heard it all before from Kanye.</comment>

    <title>B Level</title>
    <comment>This is a Somewhat B level movie but it is Fun to watch on a Saturday after noon at home with the family. My boss's Daughter is a hilarious comedy In which Tom Stansfield (Ashton Kutcher) is after his boss's Daughter. But She (Tara Reid) Believes that he is not straight. And he is asked to house sit his boss's house which is where it gets interesting.</comment>

    <title>I love this Trimmer</title>
    <comment>What I like is that it has enough power to cut my hair even in cordless mode and i can adjust the cut length without changing anything. its very easy to clean this unit , you can even wash it!. The detail trimmer seems useless but when i tried it it did the job. Another pro: It is very quiet and goes for a long time with 1 charge. You wont be dissapointed.</comment>

    <title>A fantastic addition to the Mario lineup.</title>
    <comment>This is the truest sequel to Super Mario for the Super Nintendo. Side scrolling action makes a comeback with this fantastic new game. All new powerups makes this Mario a truely unique experience. There is also numerous mini games that add for a fun diversion as well as a multiplayer mode that will have you and a friend playing as Mario and Luigi duking it out for Shine Sprites. This is a must have for any DS owner and any Mario fan.</comment>

    <title>This is the cutest show</title>
    <comment>This is so cute. Its a family saga and was done when TV shows where still Holesome. This season is still black and white, the air date for the first episode was 9/16/65. This season also has the unaired pilot as a bonus as well as the CBS Pitch Featurette. I would recomend this to anyone.</comment>

    <title>Great Protection Investment</title>
    <comment>I thought that this product was well worth the investment. The small washers that come with the product cut down on the wiggling that the lock can do while attached to the laptop. The combination is easy to change if you do have a small flathead screwdriver so other reviews that you read about how hard it is to change - it really isn't. Well worth the investment - very good cable too! Bought for college to not get my laptop stolen. Great to bring other places too. Long cable!</comment>

    <title>Entrancing Patterns and Soundscapes</title>
    <comment>A friend recommended this album to me. I have to say it was one of the scariest first listens in a long time. The music is in no way negative, or melancholy. It's quite positive and uplifting. The oddity of the vocals, the juvenile patterns on guitar and keyboards combined with technical time signatures and solid drums takes you on a trip. It's just repetitive enough to let you partake in the grooves after a couple passings. The sounds are well placed across the spectrum and there are no harsh tones throughout. This is where progressive music needs to journey. Makes me want to break out some Mr. Bungle.</comment>

    <title>Best phone case I've found</title>
    <comment>The convenience of the magnet snap is great for removal and replacing the phone. I like this much better than the belt clip case I had for my previous phone. Phone rotates to a horizonal position or vertical for comfort. Holder is well worth the price to protect your phone.</comment>

    <title>Really enjoyed this one</title>
    <comment>Being half Italian I had to pick this disc up. This Blu-Ray presentation is spectacular in picture quality. Even though the previous reviewer did not enjoy the fact that this series presents the country by following it's people, I actually liked this. I would recommend this to anyone of Italian descent or if you just want to learn a little more about the country and to view it in great Blu-Ray hi-def quality.</comment>

    <title>A Blast</title>
    <comment>I also got Guitar Hero one after I got Guitar Hero II. If you haven't played guitar hero you're in for a brand new gaming experience and if you have played Guitar Hero II you'll find Guitar Hero one to be just as addictive. A solid track list and similar game play make guitar hero one an addicting game just don't let it take over your life!</comment>

    <title>Absolutely The Best Bruce in Years!!</title>
    <comment>I have had this CD for 2 weeks and cannot get enough of it!! The best, most exuberant Bruce I have heard in years!! Not since Live in NY City!! The Sessions musicians are top notch and obviously enjoyed performing together. There is something for almost anyone in this set: country, folk, dixieland, jazz, ballad (sometimes on the same song!!).</comment>

    <title>Sound Investment</title>
    <comment>This will be my second Monster surge protector. I have an EDTV, a BOSE 3-2-1, XBOX360. Also have DishNetrwork. When i ran the satellite cable into the protector, the picture quality got worse. The BOSE got alot better, crisp bass and nice high's. For peace of mind its a definite buy. Also ran my wireless router and landline and i cant tell any difference, yet. A small price to pay if you have thousands of dollars invested already.</comment>

    <title>Fantastic Epic</title>
    <comment>Early trailers for this movie made it out to be entirely about the action. While it is filled with intense and well-shot action scenes, there is so much more to the movie. With an underlying theme of honor, 300 earns a spot among the great "guy movies" of all time. It is not historically accurate. However, unlike "Gladiator," it does not pretend to be the truth. It is based off the graphic novel which emphasises key points in history and adds an element of fantasy to them. Wonderfully acted and shot, 300 is a movie to watch over and over again.</comment>

    <title>Great Story, Great Acting, Great Movie</title>
    <comment>Edward Zwick is back with an emotional action film that has it all. The Last Samurai is a great epic movie allowing the user to search his/her own heart for the true honor of the story. Tom Cruise is great in the lead, but most scenes are stolen by new-comer Ken Watanabe. If you like action movies with a purpose, this one is for you. Director's commentary is also very informative.</comment>

    <title>TV is just getting better</title>
    <comment>Grey's Anatomy is probably the most well-written and acted show on television today. I'm a huge fan of Lost and House, but I must give this show it's due. I was not interested in watching it, but once I started, it demanded respect. For any fan of the entertainment industry, this show needs to be watched.</comment>

    <comment>Season 2 is incredible. The greatest thing about this show is it's ability to go one step further in weirdness. Like, what's a bear doing in the jungle? Oh wait, it's a polar bear. There are so many moments like that in Season 2 that I just can't wait for Season 3.</comment>

    <title>One of my favorites</title>
    <comment>What a great film! I first saw this movie when I was in high school. I was very moved by it. Nothing has changed as I recently showed it to my wife, and was again silenced by it's powerful message. It deserves a place next to films like Glory and Braveheart, movies that inspire and at the same time sober you by demonstrating perseverance in the face of abject cruelty and evil. This movie is fascinating- both on the grand epic scale and in small details that I have come to appreciate about Spielberg movies. The music and cinematography will likely bring you to tears, but they are tears that remind us of what our spirits are really meant to feel- compassion, brotherly love and indignation against cruelty. I hope that you enjoy this movie as much as I did.</comment>

    <comment>The acting is excellent and the viewer feels genuine empathy for the characters involved. Some points are emotional enough to make the most stoic among us shed tears. The fact that this is based on a real life man only adds to the drama.</comment>

    <title>Save a lot of money on haircuts!</title>
    <comment>I bought this to give myself haircuts because I was sick of paying $20 every 5 weeks. My one time $30 has already paid for itself! Very easy to use and clean, would definitely recommend it to all men with a fairly "simply" haircut.</comment>

    <title>save your money and wait for the next movie</title>
    <comment>I really tried on three occasions to watch the TV series. I liked the movies but the person staring as Blade is a horrible actor. The dialogue bogged down into monotone triades and the plot lines were rehashed from other similar television shows. I ended up only making it through one full episode before saying I should give it another chance. But after the next two, I gave up 25 minutes into each of the programs. It deserves the poor ratings it got and it's demise. Perhaps they can try it again but this time break down and pay Wesley Snipes what he needs, and bring in some professional writers. Compared to this dog, Dark Shadows should be an Emmy Award candidate.</comment>

    <title>Excellent Buy</title>
    <comment>I was a bit skeptical at the price, but I decided to buy the product, and I am glad I did. Excellent performance and duarability, the drive loads up within seconds, and I've dropped it multiple times with no consequence. If you're skeptical about spending $50-$60 on this USB drive, don't be. Its fantastic, and excellent for everyday use.</comment>

    <title>A Confusing, Beautiful, but Flawed Mess</title>
    <comment>"The Usual Suspects" is, quite honestly, one of the most overrated movies of all time. While it does have some exceptional acting, a fascinating story line, and one of the best endings ever, it's still a confusing mess. It appears that even director Bryan Singer was confused as he was making it. You'll love Kevin Spacey's performance as Roger "Verbal" Kint, but you'll hate that "The Usual Suspects" is only a poor man's "Pulp Fiction". But I will recommend this movie, if only because it has to be seen twice to fully appreciate the extravagant mess they've created. It's an admirable effort, but it's just not a great movie. Oh, what could have been.......</comment>

    <title>Must Have</title>
    <comment>If you have a HDTV and want a serious home theater you need this. This not only provides protect from sudden surges it protects itself so that you do not lose the product and equalizes the power, which is the most important aspect of this product. Everybody has seen how the screen shrinks or shakes with the air condition is turning on or while the microwave is on. This product negates that so that you are always watching your TV at it's optimal performance. It has a sleek design to it which fits into your home theater without sticking out and labels the outlets on the back. This is an incredibly convenient product.</comment>

    <title>Michael Mann's best since Heat</title>
    <comment>I never knew Tom Cruise could be such a great bad guy. But it makes sense, he has a charasmatic demeanor in all of his films no matter what the role is, but in this one, it fits the character perfectly. His facing off with Jamie Foxx, a simple cab ...(read more)driver in LA is the best matching of wits since Michael Mann's other epic, Heat, with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Easily a five star movie.</comment>

    <title>Not his best</title>
    <comment>I have been a Ben Stiller fan since Mystery Men. But I found this one to be lacking a little. It had its funny moments, but I found myself laughing extra hard because I thought the moment would be funnier but it wasn't. My anticipation is what led me to finish the movie. I own it and I haven't watched it a second time. Had I seen it at the movies first, which I wanted to but had a newborn at home, I wouldn't have bought the DVD. Good but not great.</comment>

    <title>No Problems, Fine Performance</title>
    <comment>I love the convenience of this player, and have never had any problems with it. The only glitch I've run into has been an inability to use a keyboard to enter information if the CD already has title information on the disc itself. The good side of this is that the player recognizes this information autiomatically. If you are considering this player, be sure to measure the depth of the space where you plan to put it - it is deeper than most other components I've owned.</comment>

    <comment>I bought this ram while it was on sale, roughly half off. I installed it in a snap, I ran a speed test and it did not pass the speed test. I restarted the system and ran the test again and it was fine. The only thing that i have a problem with is that it is detecting only half the ram, but that is probably due to the 32 bit vista system, I plan on upgrade sometime soon to the 64 bit system. Bang for the buck (on sale) 10 out of 10 (off sale) 8 out of 10</comment>

    <title>one of my favorite musicals</title>
    <comment>1776 is the movie version of the Broadway production of the same name. It's taken mainly from the letters written between John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Howard DeSilva as Franklin and the rest of the cast play off of each other very well. We sometimes forget that they fought the slavery issue then but couldn't resolve it. Unlike some musicals, you almost forget it's a musical because the story is told so well.</comment>

    <title>1 of the greatest games made</title>
    <comment>This is a must buy game! No matter what you have heard, this is 1 of the best PC games of all time. It is fun to play for all ages and very easy to catch onto. The only problem I see with this game now, is that there is alot of hacking in the expansion edition and the server lag is horrible for people that enjoy to play hardcore.</comment>

    <title>1 of the best games for XBox</title>
    <comment>This is an absolute must buy for XBox. The single-player was a waste of time and wasnt what everyone was hoping for. The multi-player is probably the best part of this game and is sooo much fun. Hopefully, the single-player campaign is alot better than this 1 was and that they make multi-player a bit easier to find games.</comment>

    <comment>I saw these guys on their first tour w/BonJovi, way back when. I was curious to see if dvd could capture the caine that was being raised on stage the night I saw them. Well folks, indeed it has! Not missing a step, The Bad Boys from Boston clearly have the audience wanting more till the very end. Cinderella has proven to be a consistant band. Nothing is fake about these guys. They want to deliver the best and with this concert they do!Thanks guys! If you miss a brand of music that has a special groove, buy this. I did...</comment>

    <title>Addictively Fun</title>
    <comment>I bought this game the day it came out, largely just because of the hype from the first one. I bought mine for the xbox 360, and so far it has been a blast. Mostly suited for parties with more people, but even playing by yourself is fun. The song choices are great, most everyone will like most of the songs. You can even download more via xbox live, which keeps it fresh. Overall I would reccomend this to anyone who wants something a little different.</comment>

    <title>Dragon Ball Z: Season 1</title>
    <comment>This is by far the best Dragon Ball Z release yet! Unless of course they come out with HD DVD. Whatever you hear about the "widescreen sucks," don't listen to it! The only time you can really tell there is a difference is on the oppening and closing music videos, and if you are like me, you will just skip those anyway! I would definately recommend getting this if you are a DBZ fan!</comment>

    <title>An Absolute Bang For Your Buck</title>
    <comment>Lionheart is a deffinent-must-have for Jean-Claude Van Damme fans. Filled with anger, betrayl, and the best JCVD fight scenes, by far, Lionheart tells the story of Leon(Lion), while working for the French Foreign Legion, Leon's brother is killed in the city by a bunch of drug dealers. Ecstatic about his loss, he seeks his way out of the Legion and to the city to see his sister-in-law and niece. Along the way he is in search of money to help his brother's family, so, ... well you can guess if you want to, he ends up fighting for cash and gets involved in an underground fighting circuit. The best fights of JCVD are in this movie! The best move in there is his upper-cut elbow. A really good movie for fans of Martial Arts films!</comment>

    <comment>This is a must have the Family Guy collection. All fan's of this show of coarse already know that, plus its on sale so if you dont own it now it would be a good idea to hold off on super sizing your meal at a fast food joint and just get this addition to the series.

    <title>2nd Best German Foreign Film</title>
    <comment>I purchased this film having never seen it because I remembered it winning an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film 2006. It put me in touch with Germany's history and culture nearing the Fall of the Berlin Wall when tensions and paranoia were high. I loved this movie, especially the way it ended. Aside from "Run Lola Run" this is the best German film I have ever seen. Buy it. You won't be sorry.</comment>

    <title>Best German Film Ever!</title>
    <comment>This movie is awesome! Not only would I say that this is the best German language film, but I would even go so far as to say that this is the best foreign film, period. Director Tom Tykwer was a pioneer at this time. He (along with Quentin Tarantino) helped make shooting segments out of sequence in many different ways a popular part of cinema today. Watch this movie, and you will want to change your profession to movie director. Franka Potente (Blow, Bourne Identity) delivers a stellar performance. The techno soundtrack was also a revolutionary addition that I approve of. Great movie!</comment>

    <title>Crush</title>
    <comment>This is a classic story about 6 young people trying to find the one they love. Jessica Biel Plays a unconfident teen who ruins the love between 2 people and James Van Der Beek plays a drug dealer that has nothing to lose. Shannyn Sossamon is a girl that is waiting for her boyfriend that is in Europe for vacation, when she meats Van Der Beek and falls in love. This movie covers it all, everything that you hope wont go wrong ends up going wrong.</comment>

    <title>Disappointing wall mount</title>
    <comment>Happy with my previous panasonic cordless but the family dropped it too many times. Bought another panasonic because of my previous happiness and because the new cordless was also listed as a wall mount unit. However, the wall mount is a little ridiculous. I now have a phone jutting out of the middle of my laundry room. Not sleek whatsoever! Would recommend without the wall mount.</comment>

    <title>Bruce at his best</title>
    <comment>One of my favorite Bruce Willis movies that also happens to have one of the hottest co-stars ever, Milla Jovovich, looking her best(in my opinion). It also features Chris Tucker in one of his funniest and most memorable rolls. With beautiful sets full of color that take you from ancient Egyptian ruins, to space, and then back again, this story will keep the movie lover coming back for more.</comment>

    <title>JD is less of a Jerk</title>
    <comment>Being a huge "Scrubs" fan myself, I think it means a lot to say that this is my favorite season so far. The drama is not as heavy-handed as in the previous three seasons, and the jokes are a little better. JD's character is much less of a jerk, and Dr. Reed is much more likable. Also, very significant things begin to happen in all of the characters' lives that are both compelling and believable. If you are not already a fan of this series, you should be. This is one, like "Friends" that I can watch over and over again. This is especially true for season five. Oh yeah, and the guest stars on this season are GREAT!</comment>

    <comment>I have use .mac for years. I use it for emails, photos, web page, backup stuff and more. This is the best service I ever use. I never try other service it all. I know the price is $99.99 per year to keep your service going, but it worth it to show all your stuff to your friends and familes.</comment>

    <comment>I love this cd and am currently obssessed with almost every single song on the cd! Kat DeLuna is an amazing singer and shows her latin roots through her amazing spanish and english songs! She is the next Rihanna but in latina form!! I'd recommend this cd to anyone who likes pop or latin music. This is the perfecto cd to dance to also. I really hope you buy it, because I know you won't regret it!</comment>

    <title>Fun for a little while</title>
    <comment>Super Monkey Ball:Banana Blitz is the new instalment in to the super monkey ball franchise . This time you play as same monkeys as the other super monkey ball games. Your goal is to retrieve the gold bananas this is the main part of the game, this is where the game is at its best. Nice challenging levels and fun bosses but it will not take you long before is part of the game is over.Now for the multi player there are mini game that will make you use the wiimote every way possible,some of this games will bring some entertainment some are bad ones that will make you think why they put this in the game.In the end this one that you would want to play but not buy so for this one I'd say the core of the game is good so good it will make you want more. This is one to put on your gamefly ''Q'' but not one to go out and purchase .</comment>

    <title>If you like FPS games, get it...</title>
    <comment>Halo 2 is a great game overall. This game has great graphics, game play and a great storyline. The ending to the campaign is a little dull, but all in all very fun and exciting. The ending is the only reason it lost a star with me to tell you the truth. You can play the campaign by yourself or with a partner (co-op) it progresses through a story where you find out a lot more about the covenant then in the first one. You come to realize that for the most part they are people... err... beings too. It is a good time through and through. Now as far as the Multi player goes there is a lot to do here. This is a must have for this reason. I bought this title midnight of its release and played it non-stop for an entire year (mostly online) I had to put it down when the Xbox 360 came out with its achievement base. For online multiplayer there is a lot to do from deathmatchs to capture the flag, to planting the bomb to creating your own.

    <title>New Look</title>
    <comment>Kissing Jessica Stein is one of my Favorite movies because it opened my eyes to ways of living that i had never experienced. Jessica Stein is a young Woman looking for a life partner and finds love in the back of a news paper in the classified ads. Meeting Helen is a life Changing event for Jessica and I enjoyed the Fresh humor and Flavor that this movie provides to the ever changing society of today.</comment>

    <title>Must have game</title>
    <comment>This game is phenomenal and must be played if you own an x box or 360. If you liked the first halo then you will love this game. this game has got to be the best shooter games o far, even if it doesn't have the agility factor of hiding behind stuff like gears. The fact that you can blow machines up or hijack them, or lock on with a rocket launcher and blow them sky high.</comment>

    <title>That's It?</title>
    <comment>Graphics: good, Controls: interesting. What detracts from the game. You only fly and its repetition is only surpassed by its repetition. Can't dismount and fight.... the depth of this game: shoot fire balls and shake your controller. If that's all you want to do with 60 bucks, look no further.</comment>

    <title>For fans only</title>
    <comment>Fans of the books by Douglas Adams will love this movie -- and you have to be a fan, or at least have read the books, in order to make any sense of the movie. The movie tries to cover all 5 books in under 2 hours and so the pace is breakneck. The actors do a good job with their characters, especially Sam Rockwell as President Zaphod Beeblebrox (you can believe that he would be the 'best bang since the big one') and Alan Rickman as the morose Marvin the Paranoid Android (I can't imagine anyone else being Marvin after hearing Mr. Rickman's version.) Mos Def and Martin Freeman play well off of each other and Zooey Deschanel is really good as the cute-yet-zany Trillian. What makes this movie good to watch has to be the special effects. I, personally, like the BBC Video version better as they had a little more time to explore and clarify the story of the 5 books. However, with the advances in modern CGI techniques, this movie is much better, which is to be expected. The scene where Slartibartfast takes everyone through the 'planetary production line' is alone worth the price of the DVD. Extras on the DVD like the Fake Deleted Scenes and the Sing Along to 'Thanks for all the Fish' are definitely pluses and the two separate audio commentaries are worth watching. However, I must once again caution that unless you are familiar with the books, you will lose most of the jokes and probably your patience with the story jumping leaps and bounds. But for the fans, this is definitely recommended.</comment>

    <title>Great product for the price</title>
    <comment>i use this product for my 47in plasma screen tv. I bought it about a year ago and I am still using it to this day. It can last for a long amount of time. It comes with a microfiber cloth that you definetly need for the newer screens today to prevent scratching them. There is no downside it works great and lasts a long time. GREAT BUY!</comment>

    <comment>This show is one of the funniest shows on tv, and is one of my favorites. Season three was hilarious and left us hanging on a great cliffhanger. Can't wait until the second part of season 3 comes out. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys comedy.</comment>

    <comment>This is the complete series of Spawn on a 4 disc collection. This series was originally shown on HBO, and for good reason. If you are looking for a nice show to watch, STAY FAR AWAY!! But if you are looking to watch Spawn as it was meant to be watched, then look no further.</comment>

    <title>A must have for any real collection</title>
    <comment>Possibly one of the best sci fi films since star wars, The Matix is definetly a must have. AC3 Dolby Special edition sounds so good, I had a heart attack the first time I watched it. With all the visually stimulating scenes and effects, your collection is not complete without this modern age classic.</comment>

    <title>Disappointing</title>
    <comment>I loved The Showdown's first album. When I got this CD, I imagined it to be a lot like the first, will the screaming and heavy music. If this is what you are expecting, you will be disappointed as well. This is a softer version of their first album. A much much softer version. Their are no screams, and the heavy sounds just have seem to left. Pick up the first album instead of this one.</comment>

    <title>Great Tripod</title>
    <comment>I love this item, it is a value for the money. Easy to use, does what it is supposed to do too. It's light weight, easy to set up and take down, you can attach the release plate to the camera and leave it on for quick attachment to the tripod. since it has two adjusments on each leg, its easy to use on slopes and the level helps too. It's great, I really do recommend it to anyone. Easy to carry too.</comment>

    <title>Tales From the Dirty South</title>
    <comment>Southern rock is usually panned for the all the beer-swilling, whiskey-chugging, stars and bars waving stuff that followed in the wake of Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers. You may as well put down the British Invasion as being all about "Ferry Cross the Mersey" and "I'm Henry the 8th, I Am". The truth is not only has some of the best, but some of the smartest rock come out of the south, and I'm talking way before R.E.M., Indie boy. Ronnie Van Zant might have sang songs about fishing and juking but he also composed "Mr. Saturday Night Special", the best song ever written about gun control. And unlike almost every other song about that topic, it's not didactic and rocks as hard as any "protest" song ever written. Why so much about Skynyrd? Because the Drive-By Truckers got their first national notice with "Southern Rock Opera", a song cycle (that's right a song cycle) based on that much misunderstood band. Led by Patterson Hood, son of famed Muscle Shoals bassist David Hood, "The Dirty South" tells tales of stock car racers, moon shiners and tornadoes (not to mention Sun Records) with a journalist's eye for detail and a literate, even poetic narrative. From the opener "Where The Devil Don't Stay" and it's unanswered question "Daddy...Tell me why the ones who have so much make the ones who don't go mad?" to the wrenching closer "G*****n Lonely Love", the album plays like a series of taut short stories. Their songs reflect compassion while never veering toward the insufferable strained sensitivity that renders so much "alt.country" singer-songwriter drivel with a twang. There's a sense of immediacy and realism in these tales of shut down factories and desperate lives that Bruce Springsteen's much vaunted work never comes close to. "The Buford Stick" points out that Buford Pusser wasn't much a hero since most of what he did was promote himself and arrest poor people trying to eke out a living. "Puttin' People on the Moon" is sung by a laid off factory employee who's wife died of cancer because they had no insurance It's Southerner's version of Gil Scott-Heron's "Whitey on The Moon". Chuck D once called rap the black person's CNN. The Drive-By Truckers do a much better job of chronicling life below the Mason-Dixon Line than TNN ever will.</comment>

    <title>Hilarity off the Beaten Path</title>
    <comment>For those daring enough to test the boundaries of tragic yet off-the-wall comedy, the Oblongs would be a recommended starter. Based off the "children's" book "Creepy Susie: and 13 Other Tragic tales for Troubled Children," the show Oblongs is based on a polarized dichotomy between the forces of poor and rich, good and evil, and "Yes," necessarily in that order. The Oblongs is a high contrast social critique that satirizes perspectives of society that many may not dare pursue; however, for those willing to make the exploration with an open mind, the results are nothing less than rewarding.</comment>

    <title>True surround</title>
    <comment>This is the first set of speakers that actually connect through USB and have drivers on the computer to have the best sound. Also The sound is unmatched by the other cheaper companies. Word to the wise: The 2 speakers need to be 24 inches apart or closer for best sound, meaning that if you have 2 monitors side by side, you might run into some setup conflicts. Overall best speakers I have heard in quite some time.</comment>

    <title>Comedy the way it should be</title>
    <comment>The Long Long Trailer is Comedy at its greatest. The movie which stars Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz as a married couple is full of laughs and fun and is worth buying to see the trials and tribulations of a time in the character's marriage, which resembles real life. There is never a dull moment and it is a refreshing look back at the stars of yesterday. This is a great movie for I Love Lucy fans and comedy fans alike!</comment>

    <title>EXCELLENT!!!</title>
    <comment>I bought this on a friend's recommendation. I do not have cable or dish, just regular broadcast channels, but I have a great TV with an HD Tuner. I had purchased a high rated "HD" antenna last year that was a total flop - esp. at $79.99!!! Then I was given an old HUGE old metal antenna to put in my attic and it's ok, but if the weather is bad, or whatever, the channels will have lots of static... and getting into the attic to make adjustments is a nightmare. So a bought this little $9.99 nondescript old style rabbit ears and WOW!!!! I can't believe the great reception it gets! This little guy WORKS!!!!! I may have to make some minor adjustments in the rabbit ears on occassion, but it is WORTH IT!!!!!! and just in time for FOOTBALL!!!</comment>

    <title>best film for adults</title>
    <comment>In the Mood for Love captures the pain of unrequited love in a way no film I have ever seen has. less than a year after its release it became of The Criteron Collection. Only certain film are selected for this collection. The performances are excellent. Both of the actors portray more with their faces than with the words. Filmmaker Wong Kar-wai has made a film that will stand the test of time as one of the best films ever.</comment>

    <title>Good series - odd season</title>
    <comment>A must own for sci-fi fans. This is a terrific series that many people probably missed when it aired on TV. The world of Babylon 5 is gritty and dark and very familiar. This is an odd season -- a lot of new characters introduced, and doesn't fit in as well with seasons 1-4. Still good, but it seemed like the series was wrapped up in season 4, and this season was just tacked on.</comment>

    <title>wonderful software</title>
    <comment>I like the Office Home and Student software. I have two 15 year olds that use this a lot. They have to do a lot of reports, presentations, and powerpoint presentations. It is fairly easy to use, and has really come in handy. I have a 7 year old that will be using it soon as well. The price was great.</comment>

    <title>Bad, with some nice points.</title>
    <comment>For the most part this is a bad movie. I didnt really care for the plot, the acting, or the pace of the movie. It seemed to really not know where it was going. That being said it does have a few qualities that can make it worth seeing at least once. First there are a couple pretty cool action scenes. The plot twist involving what Milla really is was neat. And it is a really pretty movie. If are looking for a movie just for the eyes this will work, but thats about all its got.</comment>

    <title>A great comeback season for the Man of Steel.</title>
    <comment>This season was great! I actually was excited to watch each episode, which has been lacking for a few seasons. I'm a huge Superman fan! And so, when I heard about this show I started watching. The first two seasons were outstanding! And then things slowed down about mid-way through the third. Things started picking back up at the end of five and in this season, they took off! The sixth season has everything you want. Plenty of mythology, even more of Smallville's twist on the mythology, romance, wit, action, and tear-jerker moments. And personally being a fan of the Lana &amp; Clark duo on this show, this season really had it all. Plenty of the forbidden. And the struggles Clark goes through this season really comes through in the character. It truly was a great season, with an explosive end. A must have!</comment>

    <comment>I bought this to replace an Energizer charger that had "konked out". This Duracell charges batteries very quick, come with 4 AA batteries and charges AAA batteries as well. I've been happy with it so far.</comment>

    <title>Awesome</title>
    <comment>This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you were not pumped after this flick, you better check your pulse. The video quality on Blu-ray via PS3 (HDMI) was exactly like being at the movie. I have heard people complain that the Blu-ray version is "grainy." Well, I saw the digital theater version and the Blu-ray version looks exactly the same. For anyone who has been under a rock, this movie is very graphic and has some brutal scenes. Most guys will love this movie. The ladies may like it for the buff guys in their underwear, I guess. Xerxes still freaks me out. With the hands on the King's back and all of the talk about kneeling in front of him. I'm not sure what that guy is all about. Disadvantage: Payton Manning's SNL skit always pops in my head when I watch the movie. I keep seeing him "throwing the rock." Anyway...I highly recommend!</comment>

    <title>Best Show on Television</title>
    <comment>Currently television is infested with bad television and that makes it hard to know what to watch or purchase. Battlestar Galactica breaks those barriers by bringing a great drama into the genre of SciFi. An updated version of the 1970s classic, this space adventure contains a cast that every week reminds the audience why it is the best show on television today. In this chapter of its 4-season saga, the intrepid Battlestar Galactica manages to continue to elude the Cylons as they seek humankind's total annihilation but also reveals new cylons that have infiltrated the battlestar and have set in motion the trap that may lead to their goal as the humans let their guard down. In addition to that, the extras feature commentary by David Eick, executive producer, for every episode and the audience can hear it just how amazing the work behind the scenes is as they travel through space to create the action and adventure that delivers such amazing work. Enjoy this show and catch up. Season 4 begins in 08. Watch out for the toasters, they're coming.</comment>

    <title>Family Guy is hilarious</title>
    <comment>Family guy is a hilarious series that didn't get much attention when it was new on Fox years and years ago. Full of political satire and edgy comedy it's one of the best fox series out since the simpsons.</comment>

    <comment>If you've been a Mario Kart fan since SNES like I have, this game is a must have. Along with new tracks, there are some classis tracks added from SNES, N64, and Gamecube. The wi-fi feature allows you to play people from all over the world. This is a good game for all ages.</comment>

    <title>Family Movie Night</title>
    <comment>This is a truely awesome movie for all ages. Billy Bob Thorton is excellent. My favorite line in the movie has to be "I can't get my family to eat dinner together, you have yours DREAMING together". And that pretty much sums up the movie! A must watch!</comment>

    <title>Must have</title>
    <comment>This is one of New Breeds best projects yet. It is diverse with a combination of multiple music genre from Reggaeton to Gospel praise and worship. One of my favorite songs Identity/I know who I am. There is Israels trademark sound which you'll find in "Say So", along with a new beautiful blend of inspirational sounds as in "If not for your Grace". This is a must have addition to your praise and worship collection of music.</comment>

    <title>Speaking of Speakers</title>
    <comment>I owned these speakers in my previous home and was so satisfied, that when I moved across country and purchased a new home, I made a B-Line to B-Buy to buy them again. They provide great sound for the average home user and they are Virtually Invisible. Imagine that! The weakness of these speakers is obvious; you have to cut holes in your walls to install them. SCAREY! But, once your fear is overcome by your confident ability to do it yourself, it can be done. I would still recommend professional installation for those who are still queasy just thinking about violating their sacred home walls. Overall, this is great product that will provide years of satisfaction.</comment>

    <title>Must have for your entertainment center</title>
    <comment>Monster makes quality products, and this surge protector is no exception. This is a must have for any home theater system. It provides all the necessary power to all of your home entertainment core components and accessories and allows for a 'clean' power source that gets rid of many of the variations in AC power that can damage components over a long period of time. Well worth the money. Consider it as a protection on your investment.</comment>

    <title>A classic</title>
    <comment>I do not have the remastered version, just the original. If you are gonna get a Primus disc this would be the place to start. This was their first studio effort and it totally rocks. Grooving bass, crazy guitar work and amazing drumming. Primus still has a great sound but this and Sailing the Seas of Cheese are thier best albums.</comment>

    <comment>I have been a huge fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost since their British tv comedy, Spaced, and of course adored Shaun of the Dead. Hot Fuzz features the same brilliant cinematography as well as the smart, snappy humor that make this comedic duo so fantastic. I highly recommend it to anyone!</comment>

    <comment>The show is incredibly funny. The writing is witty and doesn't have to dumb down any of its characters in order to be hilarious. The incredible yet mundane life of the Botwin family during its trials and tribulations while dealing in the shady business of Agrestic independent business mothers is one of the funniest shows on television and absolutely worth purchasing. Love this show!!</comment>

    <comment>Modern westerns FTW. Kurt Russel, Val Kilmer, Bill Paxton, Sam Elloit and Michael Biehn. Could you ask for a better cast? I think not. It goes without saying that this beats the heck out of the ego-fest that is Wyatt Earp, courtesy of Kevin "I'm so awesome even though I can't do a country accent to save my life" Costner. I suspect that the only other modern western that will be on par with this is the remake of 3:10 To Yuma, which I shall see soon.</comment>

    <comment>I love this game since I bought it. It is really a family and party game, everyone can play and enjoy it. I went to Bestbuy and purchased this game after I played it in friend's house. It is fun board game. In addition, it has a lot mini games which add to the fun part of this game. Anyway, I absolutely love this game!</comment>

    <title>Wonderfully entertaining</title>
    <comment>Shia is proving to be a definite up and coming star. The movie contains excellent acting and a very entertaining storyline and plot. Even though its not quite an oscar-nominated worthy film, it could probably win a teen choice or MTV movie of the year award.</comment>

    <title>For sports movie lovers</title>
    <comment>I'm biased since I'm a graduate of Marshall University and have known the plane crash story since my freshman year. The movie does take some liberties but pretty accurately follows the truth. The actors did a great job portraying the coaches and players and the adversity they had to overcome. I won't lie this movie isn't for everyone, but it is a very endearing story and anyone who loves a great comeback story will enjoy.</comment>

    <title>Good Choice</title>
    <comment>We've been using a DVD case to hold our portable player, sitting between our two front seats. There are already enough cords, but there were too many straps as well. I found this one and LOVE it! It mounts nicely to the seats, at the headrest...easy on and off. Up and outta the way. All the kiddos can see so, there is no arguing over the "best" seat. Slight jiggle over bumpy roads, but nothing significant.</comment>

    <title>work of true talent</title>
    <comment>Kanye West has never been more articulate and relevant than on this album. Again, he surprises me with his outstanding ability to tell a story without getting sidetracked and without excessive babbling about women, diamonds, cars and other meaningless topics. I literally love every track on the album. The album does not suffer from the typical beats and lyrics as most rap albums do. After purchasing this cd, I've realized that Kanye West is even more talented than I ever imagined. This has to be one of the best rap cds I have ever purchased.</comment>

    <title>It Just Doesn't Get Old</title>
    <comment>Scrubs has always been one of those shows which makes me both laugh and cry - and even laugh until I cry! The 4th Season will not let you down. All of your favorite characters are back and some of the secondary characters develop even more. From the top-notch special guest lineup to the hilarious storyline, it just doesn't get old. It's great to be able to visit Sacred Heart in Season 4 whenever I feel the need for a laugh.</comment>

    <title>He's Back</title>
    <comment>I have purchased both 50 Cent's and Kanye's albums, and while I am a huge fan of the latter--50 rlly gets things done this time. he has his bass beats--classical 50 cent songs like "i get money" and "peep show" but now he also has new age music--with faster and much slower beats--"ayo technology" sounding as though it was straight out of timberlake's "FutureSex/LoveSounds"--nice fast beat. he has the slower ones 2 like "follow my lead" with a relaxing slow, piano tune. another new thing is that he has a lot more guest artists doing the choruses--blending 50's silky voice with those of other talents (akon, timberlake, timberland, mary j blige, robert thicke, the lead singer from pussycat dolls--dont know her name) overall this album was much better than kanye's--who only had 2 good songs, "stronger," and "good life." he's back.</comment>

    <title>Netgear dropped the ball!!!</title>
    <comment>WARNING to all "Netgear Rangemax Next" buyers! I Purchased this card, the WN311T &amp; the WNR834B router last week. Both products are "Rangemax Next" wireless-N products, so you would reasonably infer that they are compatible at the Maximun speeds noted on the packaging of 300Mbps. After setting them up, I found I was only reaching 54Mpbs, even with a 80% signal. So I called Netgear Tech Support and their tech informed me that the WN311T is ONLY fully compatible (@ the highest speeds) with the WNR854T router! He went on to explain that the "Rangemax Next" product line ending in "T", i.e. WN311T &amp; WNR854T, was manufactured by "Top Dog wireless", whereas the "B" product line was manufactured by "Broadcom" and were not compatible because of the diffrent chipsets. How the average consumer was supposed to decifer this, I dont' know! Why would netgear brand both products with the "Rangemax Next" trademark when they're not fully compatible...only they would know?</comment>

    <comment>Just like every Family Guy DVD that precedes this one; Season 5 is hilarious. They just keep getting better and better. The jokes are very adult and at times; very childish. But as a fan you come to expect it. That's what makes Family Guy so great cause you dont know whats coming next! 5/5 stars is the only rating I can think of giving Season 5.</comment>

    <title>New Color and more to come</title>
    <comment>This controller is a nice upgrade from the old Xbox controllers. The controller feels stronger and yet it's a little smaller than the 1st-gen xbox controllers. The wireless controller has a very strong connection and the sleek design fits perfect on the hands. I recommend the wireless over the wired controls because you can connect four instead of just two (through the USB). Plus it saves room for the Vision cam or a external hard drive. Long lasting even with AA batterys or just use the Lith-ion battery and save some cash on it all together. I love the wireless controller and feel that it's a must for the Xbox 360.</comment>

    <comment>The series is excellent. The first season introduces the characters and develops them very well. The DVDs work well and are great viewing. The downside is no special features, deleted scenes, cast comments or any extras features.</comment>

    <title>Amazing Compilation</title>
    <comment>I love this band! It's great to finally see a compilation set of the many great pop singles over the past 10 years. Although some are missing, new tracks like Tell Me Where it Hurts and the Bad Boyfriend remix kind of make up for it. The remix CD is also great. Some of the remixes have been shortened from their original club mixes, but overall they are great. Highlight for me is the jazzy remix of You Look So Fine. Die hards probably have all of these songs/mixes, but it is still a great addition to any cd collection and a MUST for anyone not too familiar with the band!</comment>

    <title>The GREATEST GAME EVER</title>
    <comment>Halo 2 is by far the greatest game I've ever played. Especially on xbox live and system link. If I could, I would quit school just to play the game all day long. My favorite weapon on the game is the battle rifle, because it's not a no skill weapon and it is good long range and close.</comment>

    <title>Solid Option</title>
    <comment>I bought this product after much contemplation concerning this and similar products. I opted for this up-to-62 inch TV stand despite shopping for my 42 inch plasma TV on the grounds that I might upgrade in the near future. The product came in solid packaging with fairly straight forward assembly instructions. Overall this product was well worth what I paid. It is aesthetically pleasing, as it matches well with my black TV and all black components. The cable storage is sufficient to hold cables for my 2 game consoles, entertainment computer, and my home theater receiver (with audio cables included) with no problems. The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is that it only has levelers in the front. If your floor slopes up at all you will have to prop up the rear of the stand with something else. If this is not an issue with you, consider this a solid buy.</comment>

    <comment>Ignore the other review for this film. This film was an awesome throwback to classic horror/slasher films from the late 70's. Every single frame of the film shows a keen eye for detail and a wicked sense of humor. I cannot recommend this film any higher. It is one of my all time favorite films!</comment>

    <title>Best R&amp;B CD</title>
    <comment>If you miss old R&amp;B and you're looking for songs you can really feel and not just hear in the club - then this CD is for you. J Holiday is a major talent and while he's not currently getting the respect and exposure he deserves right now - if you're grown and sexy you need to get this album. Real artists need our support!</comment>

    <comment>I just love this show. Prior to them releasing it on DVD I only watched it in rerunes and I just love it. I watch it over and over and still love it. Its family oriented and funny with all the triales they go through as a new married couple. This season has some special features that include: a featurette called The Magic Unveiled, and bloopers. I highly recomend this show.</comment>

    <title>The BEST Album HIM has Put Out!</title>
    <comment>I love this CD more than life right now. I have been a HUGE HIM fan for about 5-6 years now, and I love when a new album comes out. But I was never prepared for this masterpiece called Venus Doom. The boys have really out done themselves this time. With Tim Palmer producing again, everyone knew that the album would be great. No one expected it to be this AMAZING!!!!! I would HIGHLY recommend if you want to hear a GREAT rock album, buy this CD now. This CD will not leave the radio in my car for a very very very very long time. See ya on tour boys. ! ~VP~</comment>

    <title>Awesome</title>
    <comment>Funniest show on the planet. Start here, though there are only a few episodes and its pricey for the amount its the best show on air, IE worth every cent. It'll get you hooked and ready for the onslaught from the next two seasons, which both have 20+ episodes.</comment>

    <title>A trashy, tawdry, hedonistic romp!</title>
    <comment>A unlikely winner for those who like the genre of Dynasty, Dallas, Knots Landing and other great 'serial trash' programs, Mile high delves into a world of a 'Low-Cost/Low Fare' airline, not entirely unlike the ones that have sprung up around the world today. Fresh is definitely that- full of tawdry trysts, copius amounts of liquor, and plenty of interpersonal drama- The planes aren't the only things flying high here. Although it's predominantly about the people, places, situations and difficulties, the cast nails the performance perfectly every time- a real winner in a modern era BBC/SkyTV program. The scenery takes you around Europe- and into the UK itself. On the downside, some of the plots are far-fetched, even for a fictional TV program. The situations tend to be a bit overblown, and the dilemmas the characters get into are stretched a bit. A flawless performance by JoAnne Knowles (Janice, the Purser) really locks the gear down and lands perfectly. The remainder of the cast is well talented, with Adam Sinclair (Will) and Naomi Ryan (Lehann) anchoring a great ensemble cast. Mile High will never win an Emmy- but it's good for a nice, decadent, hedonitic trip!</comment>

    <title>Okay movie.....Okay Blue-Ray...</title>
    <comment>The movie itself isnt "bad". I'm a big Will Farrell fan and pretty much love every movie he makes. However, I'm not crazy about this movie. It just seems a bit boring and the humor doesnt seem well written at times. In terms of how it looks on Blue-Ray, I wasnt impressed. Some movies just look great on Blue -Ray but I wouldnt say that this was one of them.</comment>

    <title>Good but too expensive</title>
    <comment>I had previously purchased the Bose ear buds but I could not get them to stay in my ear comfortably. So I finally broke down and purchased the OE version. They sound great, as you would expect with any Bose product. I think they are very comfortable. I have had other on-ear headphones before (Cheap Sony ones) and after about 2 hours my hears would hurt so bad that I could not stand wearing them anymore. These Bose OE headphones do not have that problem. They are very comfortable to wear for hours. (I use mine 6 - 8 hours a day...keeps my co-workers from bugging me) I am also happy with how well they block out other noises. They aren't perfect, but compared to cheaper headphones and ear buds that I have used, these are great. I work in an office/data center environment so not being able to hear 30+ racks of servers over my music is a good thing. The only downfall is the price tag. Sure, you are paying for the name Bose, you are paying for the quality....but for a high end consumer level headphone....I don't think it should go much higher than $145...but that is just me....and I still forked out $180. Great product, little pricey...but you get what you pay for.</comment>

    <title>The Best Show I Have Ever Seen</title>
    <comment>Jericho is an amazing and outstanding show. I can not wait for this show to be released on DVD as I'm getting it the day it comes out. If you have never seen this show, I highly recomend it. Its very good and keeps you on the edge wanting to see what happens next. The acting is really great with a cast of Gerald McRaney, Skeet Ulrich, and Lennie James. I can't believe it wasn't nominated for an emmy...this show well deserves it! Check it out if you haven't!</comment>

    <comment>If you want to switch to the new wireless-n technology, you should do some research. I have had no problems with this router since updating the firmware, so to those people who have problems, try that. It is a very good router, I have my desktop hard-wired, and laptop wireless using a D-link rangebooster-n card. Everything works great. But if you haven't done your homework to know how -n works, (like how all wireless devices have to be -n to use -n) then I suggest doing that.</comment>

    <title>House Rocks</title>
    <comment>I love every season of House, but this one is the best. He is more witty, there is more personal drama between the characters and there is more suspense. i would highly recomend this season! It's my favorite House season so far. It's great to go back and watch the episodes before the new season comes out, as House has really progressed as a character across all 3 seasons. get it!</comment>

    <title>Best of old technology</title>
    <comment>Excellent. Huge capacity. 8 group files. Ability to label older CDs that lack the CD titles, particularly by directly plugging in a keyboard. Would be nice if added titles could be longer than 13-character display by scroling, similar to the burned in CD titles on the newer discs. Fills the middle ground between the super high end audiophile players and the lower fidelity, but more compact MP3 players.</comment>

    <title>Hitchcock Classic</title>
    <comment>This is one of Hitchcock's best movies and one of James Stewart's best performances. (though, he has many) It is a clever movie, that gives us a lot of information with visual aids, so we may get to the heart of the story quick. It is a fun roller coaster of a movie that has stood up to the changing times. Not many movies are as relevant today as they were 53 years ago. A must see movie and one that belongs in your DVD collection.</comment>

    <title>Greatest Terminator Movie To date</title>
    <comment>T2 is the most action fulled Terminator movie in my eyes. I like the movie with its cool effects and fighting scenes. Ecspially, the final fight between the T-1000, Sarah and John Connor and the terminator. But other than that it was just a great movie with a great storyline. So if you like the terminator trilogy. Get the 2nd one and watch it at least 2 times to really get the feel for it. Once you put it in you DVD player. I guarentee you won't take it out for a long time.</comment>

    <title>Great Start to an Original Sci-Fi Show</title>
    <comment>Although I am a major fan of SG-1, the first Stargate TV show, I honestly was not sure I would like Atlantis. As you can tell by looking at the rating I gave it, I love it and can honestly say that I would recommend to anyone, especially fans of SG-1. Now, we get to the reason that I gave season 1 only 4 out of 5 possible stars. At this point, you now know that I am an insane fanatic who is obsessed with this show, but liking the show and liking its DVD releases are different things entirely. The content on this release is great and does not let down those who have bought previous Stargate box sets; however, I do have two major complaints. - 1) The menus take several seconds to play through, and obviously, you can't skip over them. ...and... - 2) There is ABSOLUTELY NO SCENE SELECTION for any of the episodes, NOT EVEN THE PILOT! Okay, now I've sang the glories of the show and screamed at the flaws of its life on disc, so I'll wrap by saying the following (this speech will not be as long as you think). "Although there are no bloopers or deleted scenes and the scene seleciton is missing, this is still a great buy for any sci-fi/fantasy/adventure fan."</comment>

    <title>The best Alien movie</title>
    <comment>One of Ridley Scotts' greatest masterpieces, this film is textbook if you are looking to make a great sequal to an established film. With extended scenes to complete the vision that the director had in mind, this film now holds a place in my 10 most watched movies. Reprising the role of Ripley, Sigourney Weaver, lost in space after an alien killed her entire crew and forced her to destroy her craft, finds herself being prosecuted by the corporation for the unexplained destruction of her spacecraft and its' precious cargo. But when a colony loses contact with earth on the same planet she claimed the creature had come from, the company recruits her to join a military task force to land and assess the situation.</comment>

    <comment>Shane Black has proven himself as a writer time and time again over the years. In his directorial debut, he proves himself a master of both crafts. KKBB has some of the most clever writing in a long time, delivered flawlessly by Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer. This movie is amazingly smart and witty. Though it was given very little publicity, this is one of the best movies of the year.</comment>

    <title>Stunning artwork</title>
    <comment>This mysterious sci-fi apocolyptic anime is best described as a cross betweet "Ghost in the Shell" and "Lain" (which is amongst my highest compliments in anime as they have long been high benchmarks in the industry) The story is about a time in the near future wear technology is fused with humanity to the point where that fine line is blurred to the point where its difficult to determine where one starts and ends. The story makes some questioning of if one is even human anymore. And you can't help but imagine that how close we could end up like this in the near future. The stylistic approach to every frame with interesting angles is a fresh perspective that kept me glued. Good pacing and minialmistic ominous soundtrack really puts the clever story telling to a different level. It has mature undertones and should appeal to all those who can appreciate deeper thinking anime and those who enjoy this gem, will be rewarded with stunning visuals.</comment>

    <comment>The movie was very slow and my husband had to be woken up after about the first 30 mins. He did not even finish the movie. The ending was very bizarre, I did not see it coming. Very twisted and very disappointing, the promos made the movie seem really interesting.</comment>

    <title>One of the funniest ever</title>
    <comment>All the seasons of this show were amazing. It is sad that it never found an audience because everything about this show is brilliant. I must confess that I never saw the first two seasons on TV but when I did see them on DVD, I tuned in for most of the third season. But, alas, by then the show had been canceled. In order to fully enjoy the show you have to watch it multiple times because you miss half the jokes because you're laughing so hard throughout. I haven't seen my DVDs in a few months but even now, just reading the titles of the episodes takes me back and makes me laugh out loud. All the actors are wonderful and the writers made sure to give everyone a memorable personality. Definitely recommended for everyone who loves to laugh.</comment>

    <title>Excellent Product!</title>
    <comment>Easy installation of this product. This product was REALLY great since it boosted the speed on my Vista laptop significantly. Just replace the original RAM sticks with this and you'll see the difference. Exceptional performance from this product so I would go and recommend this to another person.</comment>

    <title>Sweetness!!!</title>
    <comment>If you like hardcore action, with heads flying off shoulders, you will like this movie. It's really action-packed. It's a great story-line about the Spartans. When I saw it, there was never a moment, when I was bored. Something that I didn't like was the nudity in the movie. I didn't think it was needed. But other than that, this movie was amazingly done and deserves all 5 stars.</comment>

    <comment>This was the first 360 game I got and it was excellent! The gameplay is great, graphics awesome. My only regrets being that it is not "LIVE" playable and not multiplayer. Would definately reccomend to anyone who loved the movie.</comment>

    <title>TMNT</title>
    <comment>When I was a kid I was a huge fan of the Turtles watched the live action movies over and over. But of late pretty much any movie that I liked as a kid is being remade or re-mastered and destroyed in the process. This new TMNT is one of the first that feels like its being made by a fan. Written and directed by Kevin Munroe, which shows with the story and action flowing together in most cases seamlessly. The story of the brothers is strong, Leonardo and Raphael hate and love for each other comes off strong leading up to their epic fight. The rest of the Turtles aren't explored so in deathly but knowing that it's a series and that there will be more, it gives me hope for the writer to explore Donatello and Michelangelo giving them something more then just jokes on their own creation. With Michelangelo lying on the couch talking while he sleeps, saying "dude, dude, dude..." and Donatello working Help lines for computers. Though I find this funny and well written I wish it would go further into their story but I'll wait and hope it comes to that in the next installment of the TMNT. And it comes to the voice action, I found that the Turtles are done with respect, as well as giving these lifeless CGI models life. Even April and Casey done by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Chris Evans, is done well. The character that is lost with the voice is splinter (Mako), Mako also does the uncle in Avatar The Last Air Bender and is superb, having the ability to sound spacey but on point at all times. The only problem is that is not the character of Splinter and when he is demanded to be serious, his voice comes off stale. Leaving me wanting any scene that Splinter's in to end. Then it comes to the design, I found that at first I was worried not the biggest fan of CGI and a traditional animator myself. But I found the CGI to be nice stylized with traditional animation technique giving the characters a fluid flow. The Turtles are skinny but seem to make sense to their bodies. But I have to say splinter again look horrible, like a rat put through a washing machine with a Asian looking cloth placed over him. Along with splinter there are the human, which as skinny, looking as if you punched them in the face they would snap in half with the b bottom half still standing. And the thing that made me excited about it being animated was that the Turtles could actually use their weapons, because though the live action movies are amazing they lack one thing and that's a great weapon fight scene. It's just to hard in the suits, but this movie has them and has them strong, with Leo and Raph about to kill each other. All and all I'm glad that it wasn't just another live action take off, but still gave the character depth. Their anger and strength come through them as they prepare to fight. I'm just left disappointed because Splinter isn't the father figure he was in the live action films, he's more of the distant teacher that just shows up. I would recommend this film to any fan and any kid. And to those adults that can go to it as a film that's meant to entertain. 4 stars.</comment>

    <title>Classic! Great Game!</title>
    <comment>Diablo 2 and Diablo 2:LOD are the best RPG's there are. Some may say that the graphics aren't the best and they are right but it doesn't interfere with game play. It is some of the most fun I've had playing a game. It has a great item system where you can get common, unique, rare, and set items. They have 6 playable character classes ranging from : Amazon, Assassin, Paladin, Barbarian, Necromancer, Druid, and Sorceress. Each class unique and different providing numerous hours of fun. Throughout the game you can level up your character to enormous power and have amazing gear which makes you unstoppable. A game where you feel that the time you put in really made a difference. I was addicted playing every chance I had. Between trading gear and dueling I was constantly busy. A classic RPG and a must buy! Highly recommend!</comment>

    <title>The Game Is Not Out Yet!</title>
    <comment>Don't waste your time reading reviews until the game actually comes out. If you would like to know if you should invest money in to this product I would say yes but, I would also say rent the first and or only the second games first. You can not judge the series by the first game because the gameplay in Halo 3 is more like Halo 2 rather then Halo 1. (I still recamend 1 though it is one of the best games ever) If you already own Halo 1 and/or 2 and like them in the least bit, I would get halo 3. I have had the chance to play the beta-version already through the game crackdown. I love what they have done to the game such as a new aray of weapons,gernades,and maps.(this is to say the bare minimum remember it was only a demo) In a wrap up I would say get one while you can because it is projected to be the biggest game release of all-time!</comment>

    <title>His Best Work Yet</title>
    <comment>This CD has alot to offer for his previous fans and his soon to be new ones. I can honestly say that this CD is the closest to becoming the first CD were every song is good. The reason why I say the closest is because the song "Barry Bonds" is not quite to my liking.(But you might like it) Otherwise, the 12 other tracks are terrific! It is not your average "thug" rap you get from every other rapper. (if you want that go buy the new 50 Cent CD) This CD is one of a kind, just like his previous CD's. He offers rap mixed with almost all types of music you wouldnt think would mix well but it does!</comment>

    <title>Coolest Movie</title>
    <comment>This movie is so cool that even four years after it's release date, I tell people that my nickname is "Cleric", because of the awesome character that Christian Bale portrays. It is my opinion that Christian Bale is the best actor of our generation, and he is terrific in this film as John Preston, better known as the senior Cleric of the Tetragrammaton, who uses the art of "gun karta" to outmatch any number of foes. Equilibrium is a chilling look into a potential future with lots of censureship and violence. If you have ever read the book "Fahrenheit 451", it's like that, only lots of cool guns and special effects. One of my favorites.</comment>

    <title>Funny stuff</title>
    <comment>This is the fifth installment to Larry David's hit HBO comedy series. If you liked Seinfeld, you'll love this show because it takes that same situational comedy to the extreme. Although I would have to say that this is the least funniest of seasons of the show so far, it is still a must have. Even the least funny episode will have you laughing until your stomach hurts. As far as the product's format goes, I love the way that the DVD is packaged. It has two sliding tabs that you pull on and the discs will magically be revealed. The menus on the DVD are also very user friendly.</comment>

    <title>Nice Product</title>
    <comment>I have owned this product for over a year now. It is durable. It looks nice both open and closed. There is a center support, which is necessary in order to make this cabinet rigid, and durable though it is inconvenient to remove DVDs that are just behind this support. You will need to remove several DVDs to one side of the support and slide the selected Dvd directly behind the support to one side for removal. If you place this cabinet on carpet, it will lean backwards against the wall when opened because the load is off center. This does not happen when the doors are closed i.e. load equalized. This was not a problem for me. This leaning will not happen if the cabinet is place on a non-carpeted floor. It is durable. It hold allot of media. The construction was of quality. It was somewhat time consuming to assemble. The assembly instructions were easy to follow.</comment>

    <comment>For the last couple of years I have rented a steam cleaner. I payed about $100 for everything to rent it for a day. I bought this a few days ago and it did twice the job as the one commercial cleaner that I rented. We have two kids and a dog so our carpet is usually trashed.</comment>

    <title>Not the Best but Still Great</title>
    <comment>This movie was great throughout but the downside of it was it had some really awquard moments in it that made even the biggest fans feel like something didnt belong. The biggest example of this was a scene were Peter Parker started to dance around. You have to see the movie to understand what I mean. If you can weather past the non-sense it has unbelievable special effects, and can be considerd "ahead of our time" in the way movies are made. I would say it is worth the money.</comment>

    <comment>If you've ever worked in the food service industry, "Waiting" is a Must See. Ryan Reynolds, although not typically my favorite actor, does an excellent job as the main character in this movie about working in a chain restaurant. As a former waitress/host/bartender I found this movie to be a good, hilarious reflection of what really goes on in the kitchen. My favorite part of the movie centers on a rude customer who gets some "extra attention" to her meal. Also hilarious was the dopey restaurant manager trying to help out in the kitchen, but rather just gets in the way. I'm usually not into the crude type of humor featured in "Waiting," but I couldn't help but love some of the practical jokes and rites of passage featured at the restaurant. This is definatley a must see movie for anyone who has EVER been so lucky to work such a thankless job in the food service industry.</comment>

    <title>Classic</title>
    <comment>Along with Superbad and 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up will be known as one of the classics from the '00 era. This movie has heart, which is missing from a lot of comedies these days. Hilarious from start to finish.</comment>

    <title>Greatest Sci-fi-western ever made</title>
    <comment>Firefly takes the best of everything entertaining and combines it all into the best, most short-lived TV series ever. Action, comedy, diverse interesting characters, romance, space travel, scoundrels and heros. I would recommend this to anyone, because it has something for everyone.</comment>

    <title>Wake up Mr. West</title>
    <comment>Now I am a big Kanye fan. But I admit that this CD was not his best work compared to the other 2 that he started with. If your a big fan then it is a buy. But if you usually don't listen to mr. west, then I would start with college drop out....</comment>

    <title>Worst Purchase Ever</title>
    <comment>When I purchased this game I was excited and thought it would be fun to play with. On the game it says that the game is fun and has catchy songs. I played it for 5mins with my brother and it was the worst game that I have ever played.</comment>

    <title>Lacking Content</title>
    <comment>I have no doubt that Guitar Hero Rocks The 80's is a good game it is just lacking some of the song content and runs on the same engine as GH2. Worth buying so get it and start playing you will be instantly addicted.</comment>

    <title>Two Thumbs Up</title>
    <comment>This movie was eagerly anticipated for a very long time, and for good reason. The game Final Fantasy 7 was amazing and deserved an equaly amazing sequel, and this CG film completely fufilled that daunting task. With a very deep storyline that every person who played the game would appreciate (because the game's story was deep) and graphics that completely blew my mind so much so that I had to pick up the pieces later, this film will expand your mind. I can see that the story might be slightly confusing to someone who knows not the world of final fantasy 7, but this minor set-back will be swept away by amazing fighting sequences, thrilling voice-overs, and dazzeling visuals.</comment>

    <title>I Love This Movie!</title>
    <comment>This movie is written and directed beautifully by David Duchovny. Duchovny plays a man looking back on his adolescent friendships with a mentally challenged man and an incarcerated woman. As an adult he must come to terms with a tragic event from his youth. This is a heartwarming film, and I enjoyed it very much.</comment>

    <comment>Purchased two 1 GB stickes on Thursday 9/13/07 at local store. The price was outstanding at $42.99 each. I had the Geek Squad install the memory. The entire package deal was less than $100.00. I highly recommend this product and the Best Buy Staff.</comment>

    <title>This Isn't A Competition</title>
    <comment>I'm not going to diss anybody in this review. Kanye West's 'Graduation' definately shows Kanye's graduation in the music scene. If you want a C.D. that you can throw on and just listen to it all the way through, this is it. All of his songs are strong and great. The only one I don't like as much is 'Drunk and Hot Girls', but you can still listen to it. Kanye also stepped out of the boundaries by colaborating Chris Martin from Coldplay (who I love too) on 'Homecoming', and that song is still stuck in my head. Overall, this is a must have C.D. and is worth every penny!</comment>

    <comment>This was the last in the Alien series, following some many, many years later. The corporation is gone, but LT. Ripley is reborn &amp; the Aliens come too! Everthing goes wrong &amp; that when the people start to died then the Queen has a baby the same way a human woman does....need I say more! I recommend buying this movie for yourself to find out what happens next!</comment>

    <title>Robyn's Return</title>
    <comment>Geeks hate it when their heroes disappoint them, especially when their heroes sign to major labels. Robyn Hitchcock had a devoted cult following in the mid-eighties, even though only one of his albums either solo or with his band the Soft Boys had managed to get released in the states. He blended John Lennon, Syd Barrett and Bob Dylan to become a classic English eccentric. Like your favorite uncle, but if he frequently showed up at your home with Prawns and Zucchini. When Creem Magazine ran a Hitchcock cover with the caption "God Walks Among Us", his fans took it as fact, not hyperbole. Like Springsteen in 1976 and the Hold Steady today, he reminded a lot of people of why they loved rock to begin with. All this fervor get him signed to the major label A&amp;M after years of small indie labels. And then... He promptly begins to make the least interesting music of his career culminating in "Perspex Island", where some amazing songs are ruined by the major label polish. Since leaving the major labels behind he's regained his muse recording for the kinds of labels he started off with. His latest "Ole Tarantula" features a supergroup of sorts with REM's Peter Buck and Scott McCaughey of the Minus 5 plus appearances from members of the Soft Boys. It's easily his best electric album in twenty years. And in "(A Man's Got to Know His Limitations)Briggs" he someone manages to write a downright moving song based on the Dirty Harry movie "Magnum Force". Robyn Hitchcock plus arcane movie references make me one happy music AND movie geek.</comment>

    <comment>The new Kanye CD Graduation is a fairly decent cd. At first I didnt like it too much, however I'm starting to get used to it and like it more and more. It is fairly short, not alot of tracks, but still its good. The beats are nice, and the lyrics are ok. Overall I would recomend, but its not on my must have list.</comment>

    <title>Very nearly perfect remote</title>
    <comment>I'm not generally a fan of Sony. When I wanted a new universal remote, I looked around for a day or two, did some research and kept coming back to this inexpensive remote that promised so much. I am completely satisfied. This little gem handles every piece of audio and video equipment I threw at it. Handled the ten year old stuff as well as the brand new items. Gave me lots of flexibility to map specific functions for each device to unused (yet sensible) keys. I have truely been able to put all of the other remotes in a drawer and haven't needed them to program a vcr or tweak the dvd player. Buy this remote, especially if you are considering one of the much higher priced ones.</comment>

    <title>The Battle Within...</title>
    <comment>The first Spider-Man movie was very well done. It's predecessor, Spider-Man 2, was even better, ranking as one of the best superhero movies ever made. But what about Spider-Man 3? Does it rise to the occasion and join the other two films to form a solid superhero trilogy? Some may beg to differ, but my answer is yes. There are several reasons for this answer, the first of which is the action. The action sequences and fight scenes aren't terribly new or groundbreaking, but are still on parr with the first two films and are fun to watch. Venom, Sandman, and Harry are all colorful comic book characters that serve as good antagonists to Spider-Man Though it hasn't been a large aspect of the Spider-Man films, humor has always been a welcome part of the movies in the past. Even among the darker nature of Spider-Man 3, comic relief still finds its way to the surface now and then. Peter Parker's attempt to be a bad boy is a failure, but still funny to watch. Best of all, Bruce Campbell returns with a cameo appearances that tops the other two. However, even though the laughs are funny and the action is exciting, I think this film's greatest credit is its story. Sam Raimi successfully takes the black suit and uses it to spin a story of vengeance and anger which is in turn replaced by redemption and forgiveness. Peter Parker showcases these themes in a manner that is epic, yet touching. Overall, I must say the story is what makes this movie a winner. So does this movie live up to the other two? Once again I say that it does. Though the surreal nature of this film is a bit of a departure from the more down-to-earth elements of its predecessors, the story is still as well-crafted and true as ever. Put in this movie and let yourself go into the epic, exciting comic book world. You won't regret it.</comment>

    <title>Smooth, attractive, and stays put!</title>
    <comment>Its a nice all around mouse-pad. The surface is hard and slightly textured, but the bottom has a no slip foam on the bottom that keeps it from moving. &lt;P&gt; The picture doesn't really do it justice, the bubbles are very techno looking like its actually mercury or something... It looks pretty cool sitting on your desk, and it matches your black key-board. &lt;P&gt; My one complaint would be that sometimes the glossy surface makes my optical mouse go crazy, which isn't cool when I'm playing first-person shooters!! I think this would be perfect for an office desk though.</comment>

    <title>Not for the comic book fans</title>
    <comment>When the Doomsday story arc began on the comics, many were excited to see how it developed. What made the story arc so interesting was how it began so simply and developed so complexly into a single menace that threatens Superman's very existence and life. So when it came to that battle at Metropolis, Superman made his last stand there to make sure he does whatever it takes to take Doomsday out. . The animated adaption doesn't follow the story arc from the comic book version at all. Only a few key elements from the comic version made it into this movie. While I question as to how Doomsday first appeared and arrived on Earth, some things are needed to simplified. Sadly, historical elements regarding Doomsday itself were left out completely. It's understandable that it needs to be omitted, since the historical part were written afterwards and was written separately from the mainline story arc. Another piece that adapted well was Doomsday's utter brutality upon encountering any life form. There are maybe one or two parts that were over-the-top but still at least within Doomsday's character. . One disappointing factor was how simplistic the story approached the Doomsday vs Superman match-up. It did not take long for Superman to get right into the action of battling Doomsday and even less time for the street fight to end. And how it all ended was just as horrible as how the entire adapted story was written. . The entire movie is composed of two parts. Superman vs Doomsday and the Return of Superman... or Supermen. Neither of which followed any memorable elements from the comic book version. While it's understandable that the Return arc would have complicated and extended the movie more, it would have been a whole lot better as a movie experience had it been done that way. . This movie overall is a poor adaption of the comic version. A lot of key and crucial elements were missing and including a certain character as part of the story made it worse. I say... stay away from this DVD. It's not worth your money. You'll get better entertainment out of reading the comic version, of which there is a trade paperback release out there. Ask your local comic book store about it and buy the copy if available.</comment>

    <title>Cool Movie</title>
    <comment>I purchased this movie today and just completed watching it. I must say, DC Comics did a good job craming a "classic" story onto DVD. If you read the comic when Superman was killed, you'll notice many differences in the DVD. I won't go into specifics so I don't spoil it. One thing I wish they would have used would be the original character voices from the animated TV show. Hopefully DC can make more of these and compete with Marvel's anumated features.</comment>

    <title>Truly is a GOOD game</title>
    <comment>I have had this game since the day I bought my original Xbox back in 2001. This whole time I have thought of the Halo series being merely above average. Don't get me wrong, I have always been a fan but I guess I never REALLY gave in to the 'Halo craze.' Well, in preparation for Halo 3 I am playing through the games again, and I must say... WOW. Even now this game holds up VERY well, even considering the many many shooters I've played in the past 6 years. This truly is an awesome game. If you've never played this game (shame on you), setup your surround sound and prepare to be blown away! PS Don't forget to try your luck, no, SKILL, out in LEGENDARY- it is one of the most rewarding difficulties in any game!</comment>

    <title>J@ckass this is not</title>
    <comment>Terrible.....That word describes this movie. I saw the previews on TV and thought this would be like J@ckass. It was not close and most of the movie was dialogue. These guys are pretty brave with some of the stuff thats done. Especially the little guy, who gets lipo-suction while awake! Overall they fall short in a movie that has you fast forwarding to get to the good parts, which are few and far between. Avoid at all costs.</comment>

    <title>Expectations Dashed</title>
    <comment>Porco Rosso, the ninth edition to my Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli collection, contains gorgeous scenery, wonderfully detailed animation with a style all its own, and those special elements, the young heroine, the curse and the wrinkled, old woman, specific to Director Hayao Miyazaki's movies. It has a humorous, heart-warming cast and an incredible score composed by Joe Hisaishi that enhances the experience of the Italian/Mediterranean setting. YET it is the weakest and least successful of his films. Throughout my first viewing, I kept excitedly asking myself, "How is he going to surprise me?" I guess I got what I wanted because I was surprised. It was completely different from any other ending that I've seen from his work. Instead of the normal happy ending where we see the results of the curse's removal, he ends it just before the final fight and chooses to skip forward a few years to have the heroine narrate the conclusion in retrospect. Leaving the ending up to the viewers' imaginations might have been a good idea had the important subplot been developed. The film did not explain why, when or how Porco was transformed into a pig by a curse. Nor were the specifics of the curse revealed, weakening the overall plot and especially the ending. I expected the ending to resolve these things, but it left me sadly disappointed. P.S. You only get to see Porco's human face once! That disappointed me too. My shallow soul cries out for a handsome hero!</comment>

    <title>Love the performance, when it isn't broken</title>
    <comment>When the steam vacs came out, I was one of the first to run out and buy one, of which I found it to be fabulous and very easy to use. I was recommending it to everyone! Then as some time went on, a small part broke and so I brought it back to be serviced. To my suprise, they couldn't repair it but instead, gave me the option of picking out the latest and greatest Hoover Steam Vac, of which I picked out the one with the similar price. At first I thought great, a brand new steam vac, but as time went on and 4 New Hoover Steam Vacs later- all with its own separate issues, I am not finding it so Fabulous! The latest thing that happened was after a one time use, the liquid soap dispenser fell off and the bottom brushes stopped rotating. I take care of my steam vac with the utmost care and am puzzled each time with its problems. I do say I keep going back to the Hoover because of its great performance, but am tired of bringing it in to be serviced. My next exchange may be a different Brand!</comment>

    <comment>WOW. I recently purchased these speakers for my computer soley based on the reviews. I must say that this was an excellent purchase. I've not turned the music off my computer!!! The sound from the speakers is absolutely amazing. Another great feature is you can also use these speakers with your TV. I am definitely going back for another set for my tv.</comment>

    <title>Excellent card for the money, but ...</title>
    <comment>This is a reliable card like every SanDisk memory card I have purchased before (including CF, SD, and Memory Stick Pro Duo). Like the others, this card is EXTEREMLY affordable, reasonably fast, and very reliable. The only issue may be if you are looking for a very fast card for burst mode on higher-end cameras, especially those with inadquete buffers that rely on the card's performance too much. On my Canon S3 which shoots at 2.5 fps in burst mode, it never slowed down and I could have literally filled up the card without a hiccup. I do wish they published the speed rating of the card, but for the money it is PLENTY fast. If you're using a DSLR or higher-performing pro camera you should be looking at 50-66x cards (min) anyway.</comment>

    <title>House is Great!</title>
    <comment>This is an amazing and ingenious show. The content is intriguing and intelligent, and the characters are so contrasting. I think Dr. House's character is, for some, the stereotypical doctor who may have a bad attitude, be uninterested in his or her patients, and at the same time be brilliant. Some think that House is too crass and sarcastic, but I love his character. This show is much like CSI - in a hospital. This is definitely a must see!</comment>

    <title>It has everything</title>
    <comment>-I was skeptical about this movie at the beginning, but man I was wrong. This movie has everything that is awesome. Hot chicks, weird bat-like humanish creatures, gore, flesh eating, broken bones, and of course unexpected awesomeness. -The only thing that I thought was not awesome was after two of the main characters encounter the creatures they automatically became amazing fighters and crazy. -On a side note, I saw this movie with my fiance and one of my friends and his girl and my friend left halfway through. He straight up told that he was scared and he was going to have nightmares. He's 23. It was awesome.</comment>

    <title>Must See!!!</title>
    <comment>I was hooked on Jericho from the first second of the show. Jericho is the kind of show that television has needed for a long time. Quality storylines and acting. The cliffhangers are awesome. You never want each episode to end. Jericho makes you stop and think, because it really could happen. It makes you wonder how you would react in the same situation. Unfortunatly it was cancelled after the first season. But, the fans liked it so much, that we started a campaign to bring it back. We won! CBS agreed to bring Jericho back for another season. You can't miss it! You have to see what all the buzz was about. Start now with the first season on DVD, so that when the second season starts, you will be up to date with Jericho happenings. I am positive that you will not be disappointed and that you will enjoy it as much as I and thousands of other fans did!</comment>

    <title>Great With Beer</title>
    <comment>If you like Jamie Kennedy, then you'll love this film. Actress Maria Menounos is hot and adds a certain something to the story. The film is really funny after you've had a few beers. I will admit that Malibu's Most Wanted was probably better than this movie although this film is certainly worth seeing. Next time you're kickin' it with your friends, put in Kickin' It Old Skool.</comment>

    <title>Funniest Movie ever</title>
    <comment>-I used to think Zoolander was the funniest movie, but I was wrong, dead wrong. This movie is the funniest. Despite other reviews, because this movie has no huge stars in it is what makes it so funny. a big star in this movie would definitely take away from the awesome. There were several parts that I had to rewind many times. -It's a different kind of humor so it's probably a hit or miss movie, but if it doesn't hit with you then you have no soul.</comment>

    <comment>Stargate Atlantis is an even better series than the original Stargate. The third season expands some of the characters' back stories (there are some major characters who haven't been touched upon yet), introduces new characters and unfortunately, says goodbye to some much-loved others. Very enjoyable.</comment>

    <title>Good Protection!</title>
    <comment>If you have a lot of money invested into your home theater system, this surge protector is only a small price to pay. It has a digital display of the current voltage that is easy to view. All the outlets are color-coded and labeled to help organize and make it easy to tell where to plug things in. The outlets are also spaced apart enough to use every outlet.</comment>

    <comment>I love surreal movies that make you think beyond the here and now. This is not one of those movies. If the goal of the director was to confuse and annoy, then he has succeeded. I want the time I wasted watching this movie back so I can do something productive with it.</comment>

I was a bit concerned about having to replace the stock battery cover, but now I prefer Nyko's cover with added grip.</comment>

    <title>A must-see for action fans!</title>
    <comment>Absolutely stunning action movie. The style, the dialog and humor, the energy level that was held throughout... and of course two leads who throw themselves into any large crowd and deliver beatdown after beatdown. Their reactions to every threat they encounter are perfect. This was refreshing and a big surprise. Now I must admit I just rented the movie, but will eventually buy it. The rental is of the same release, but only contained the first disk, so I can't comment on the extras. But, at least for Asian films, the transfer looked fine and the subtitles were of course not perfect but still good. Actually, this is probably one of those movies where you won't even need subtitles to know what's going on and enjoy the best moments.</comment>

    <title>Great Show</title>
    <comment>This is one of the funniest shows on TV. Even watching them for a second or third time we still laugh. We were so glad to see this come to DVD. Its one show we will watch over and over as it stays funny no matter how many times you watch it.</comment>

    <title>Best Comedy</title>
    <comment>This is the best comedy ever. The theme centers around an office of mediocre employees who hate their jobs. My favorite part is when they smash the office printer in a field.</comment>

    <title>Game for all ages</title>
    <comment>Everyone, and I mean everyone, should get this game. My 17 year old son is the primary user and it draws all of his friends to our house. My 24 year old daughter loves it, my husband loves it, and I've even played it. My mother in her 60s even gave it a try.</comment>

    <title>Very fun golf game (with a few problems)</title>
    <comment>This is the first version of Tiger Woods I have played and for the most part I have loved playing the game; I really like the career mode and all of the equipment you can unlock by completing certain feats. The difficulty is easily adjustable so I can enjoy it and my nephews can too (without them getting frustrated.) The different golfers look, for the most part, like their true selves and the golf courses look great. There are a few things that are really annoying though. Mainly, the crowd sometimes gets in the way of shots; if you are in the rough there are a lot of times where they just do not get out of the way and are in direct line for where you are hitting so you either have to take a route away from where you want to hit or drill it right into them (which is fun too since there are some funny animations for when you hit spectators.) I have also had problems where, for no apparent reason, the sound in the game will go out; this is the only game this has happened on and the only way to get sound back on is to quit the game and restart it (which wouldn't be so bad if you could save in the middle of a round.) And that brings up my last problem with the game; no saving in the middle of rounds.....not a game killer but it is annoying (edit: after thinking about this I can see why this is not included to prevent saves after every good hole; but it would be nice if you could save at the turn or something.) Overall this a really good game with some minor annoyances; definitely recommended for the golf fan.</comment>

    <title>Incredible Film...</title>
    <comment>Transformers is easily the best Sci-Fi movie from the Summer 2007 lineup, although that was frairly easy with cfrap like Shrek 3, Spiderman 3, Pirates otC 3, etc. But still it is a great movie with some truly amazing special effects. I have seen the movie many times, and one could call me a fanboy, but I cannot give Transformers a 5 Star Rating because the "Bonus Disc" is now something one must pay an addtional fee for, something I find disturbing and downright greedy. But I guess that the publisher feels the extras are worth it, and I'll probably be suckered into buying the two disc version regardless.</comment>

    <title>All Good Things Come to an End</title>
    <comment>Giving comedian Ray Romano a television show was one of the smartest decisions in TV history. The ability to find unique humor in every family situation was the show's specialty. The only thing bad about the 9th season is that it's the last one.</comment>

    <title>Infiniti on High!!!</title>
    <comment>This is a great CD! Though I thought it caught a couple of duds towards the middle of the album, I would definately recommend it to any FOB fans. Infiniti on High grabs you with a punchy into, "Thriller", keeps your interest with great line up,"Hum Hallelujah", "Thnks fr th Mmrs", "Bang the Doldrums", and then leaves you wanting more with the Exclusive, "This ain't a Scene, it's an Arms Race." A must have for any dance music lover!!!</comment>

    <comment>Halo was the game that ushered me into the world of Xbox, and this sequal surpassed the original. The single player campaign is very enjoyable, but the multiplayer modes are what give Halo 2 limitless playability. Just playing with friends at home or with a system link is awesome, and Xbox live only enhances this experience. If you enjoy first person shooters and sci-fi, then Halo 2 is for you.</comment>

    <comment>I have been looking for a Blindside DVD for what seems like ten years, and finally, I have found it! I will tell you that this CD is definately worth the time spent looking for it! I love Blindside's music, they are an amazing band that puts on a fantastic performance every show. With their high energy stunts and Christians crowd walking, even if you aren't a Blindside fan, you should definately come up off a little bit of cash to get this amazing DVD!</comment>

    <title>This Time...</title>
    <comment>Blindside's latest release (exempting the Black Rose of course), "The Great Depression" is a fabulous CD. If I had written this review immediately after I purchased it, I would have said that I wasn't too impressed, but I have found that "The Great Depression" grows on you like some sort of wonderful ViRuS! I can honestly say that after I listened to it a couple of times, I couldn't stop! Much like the rest of Blindside's releases, I can listen to the full album all the way through! I hate when you have to skip around the tracks in order to find one that is worth listening to! Ask me now, and I'll tell you, BUY THIS ALBUM!!! Because Blindside definately didn't disappoint This Time...</comment>

    <comment>Had a set of infinity speakers that I thought were pretty decent until I plugged these in. Was like a night and day difference in sound quality. These speakers were so lifelike that you could almost see the music in the air !! I now use them (bose) for everything from home theater to just plain stereo receivers. Try them and you will see the difference for yourself !!</comment>

The story line is good unlike anything I've seen and come on, we live on reality tv now in days so this story line is great. Those who doubted stone colds acting abilities better check them selves at the door because he did better than you'd expect. overall Good movie!!!</comment>

    <title>Another Great Season</title>
    <comment>So far I have enjoyed every season of Smallville. They do not dissapoint, and this is another one. It keeps you wanting more, and getting the season on dvd is great because you can watch them completely through and get ready for the new season coming up. I recommend this to everyone.</comment>

    <title>Must see for Superman Fans</title>
    <comment>This movie was pretty good, its has 2 story lines (the death of superman and the return of the man of steel) movie is filled with action and drama, but one thing it lacked was informing viewers the history on Doomsday. it gives about a 5 sec. or less history lesson on him. If you've seen/read the comics there's differences and some scenes could have been added to the movie, The fight scene could have been made longer more drama (common its the death of superman). But, overall its a good movie and a must see for all superman fans</comment>

    <comment>The new version of office 2007 is excellent for giving that essay, powerpoint, excel, etc. that special final touch that would be sure to please anyone. There are many new funtions and also easier navigation but takes a while to adjust to the new menu bar but is simple and efficient after prolonged use. I HIGHLY recommend this product for students.</comment>

    <comment>This is one of the best albums ever. If you like hard gangster rap with really nice beats then this album's for you. This c.d. has Outstanding Hits! 1) Warning 2)Ready to die 3)The What 4)Juicy 5)Big Poppa are all "must listen to tracks" on the album. If you like Biggie (a.k.a Notorious B.I.G.) then you need to buy this album, it's by far his best one. Other good albums by him include "Life after death" where he really shows that he's one the best rappers ever. This is a double-cd album and has "must listen to tracks" such as 1)Notorious Thugs 2)Hypnotize 3)Miss U 4)Kick in the door5) #!*@ you tonight (feat. R Kelly) 6)Last Day 7)I love the dough (feat. Jay-Z w/ Angela Winbush 8) Mo money mo problems (feat. Mase/P. Diddy) 9) Long Kiss Goodnight. Overall, alot of good songs, and honestly every true Biggie fan must have these c.d.'s!</comment>

    <title>Great Story</title>
    <comment>Guns of Navarone is a story about two great big guns on a island in the Mediterranean. A Special task force is sent there to destroy these weapons to open up the Mediterranean to the Allied Powers. This is a great Movie about the actual events that took place on Navarone.</comment>

    <title>Edge of your seat movie!</title>
    <comment>This movie will keep you entertained until the finish. It starts off good and finishes even better. Definetelly one of those movies that has you on the "edge of your seat." Really entertaining and I can't say it's not scary because overall it depends on the type of person you are. A great movie and I am mostly certain that you will enjoy watching it a 2nd time! I recommend buying The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning as well. Both great movies. Note: If your lost/confused in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, stop and watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning first. Then you will understand everything!</comment>

    <title>Getting Better With Age</title>
    <comment>I have been listening to this CD for about three weeks now, and I have really been mesmerized by it. The Goo Goo Dolls are maturing to that point where their music is taking on a bigger sound that reeks of maturity. Even if a lot of the mainstream rock reviewers still bring up the classic Replacements comparisons, GGD to me have a sound that is wholly their own and one that I can listen to for hours on end without getting tired of it. The other thing I love about the Dolls' music is that it can serve two purposes: it's equally good as a workout soundtrack at the gym as it is with a mammoth set of over-ear headphones laying back on the couch. I can't criticize this effort... it's simply great music!</comment>

    <title>Desrves to win Album of the Year!</title>
    <comment>This album was well worth the buy and definitely a career best from Kanye West. His past albums have been great also but this has got to be my favorite one yet from him. His ryhming and play on words are great while he also gives a message in the lyrics. My favorite tracks are: 1. Good Morning, 2. Champion, 4. I Wonder, 5. Good Life and 13. Big Brother. If you like Kanye and his music, then you will love this album.</comment>

    <title>A Decent Listen...</title>
    <comment>This is, in my opinion, not Blindside's best release to date, but non-the-less a good cd. It kicks off with a bang, but then busts a little until an unforgetable remastering of "Superman" and "Teddy Bear". It also includes one of my favorites, "The Shoulder", and just what every fan needs; four bonus tracks from their original demo version!!! While it isn't the best, I would definately say it is worth buying.</comment>

    <title>This CD BLEW my mind!!!</title>
    <comment>I was introduced to Blindside with their record release of "Silence", but I was blown away when I heard this cd! It includes some of their more trademark songs like, "King of the Closet" (AMAZING SONG) and "Vow of Silence", but the rest of the CD should receive equal acclaim. "Sunrise" being one of my personal favorites, along with the entirely Sweedish song, "Nara", are definate marks showing their musical talent. Get this CD, or miss out on some awesome music!</comment>

    <title>There's nothing better than a clean slate</title>
    <comment>Batman Begins is to the Batman franchise what Casino Royale was to the Bond franchise - a desperately needed shot in the arm and breath of life for a series that had grown stagnant. In the case of the Batman series, it was thanks to an absolute garbage fest from Joel Schumacher, the truly awful and detestable Batman and Robin which was more like a live action cartoon than a film. Christopher Nolan starts fresh, showing the origins of Batman and how he became the man he is in a truly classy way without just rehashing the same old story about how he lost his parents. Christian Bale is BRILLIANT in his execution not only as Batman, but as Bruce Wayne. This is the first time that an actor has pulled off both personas perfectly. The presence of the Scarecrow and Ras Al'Guhl for the villain aspect is so well done by Cillian Murphy (best crazy man ever!) and Liam Neeson respectively. I can't wait for The Dark Night, it will be monumental and above all, epic.</comment>

    <comment>I love David Crowder Band, his music is so fun to listen to and always has a great beat. You'll find he creates music with something different (like some awesome bluegrass and hoedown tunes! -trust me it's fun). This CD is filled with a lot of praise about the joys of Heaven!</comment>

    <title>"No women, no kids."</title>
    <comment>A masterpiece by Luc Besson, director The Fifth Element and writer forThe Transporter. The talented Jean Reno, a hitman in this, rescues a little girl by simply opening his apartment door while her family's place is hit by crooked DEA agents over a...(read more) drug related thing. From there they go on a crazy journey which ultimately leads to facing the agent in charge of that whole debacle, played by the amazing Gary Oldman. Great action sequences and plenty of quoteable lines. Easily 5 stars.</comment>

    <title>A Perfect Introduction to Blindside!!!</title>
    <comment>Silence was my introduction to the never disappointing band, Blindside. I instantly fell in love with their relentless talent for producing songs, or even whole CDs for that matter, that you can listen to over and over again! This fine specimen of a record contains some of their hit favorites like, "Pitiful" and "Time Will Change your Heart", but we can't forget about the rest of the great works that they gave us, "Sleepwalking" offers us an unbelievable bridge that you won't see coming, "The Endings" has so much punch in it, just goes to show that sometimes the simplest riff is the best sounding and the beautiful work of art they christened, "Silence". Get this CD and catch a glimpse of one of the most impressive bands to come out of Europe!!!</comment>

    <title>great for the price</title>
    <comment>i bought this to put in the baby's room for nap &amp; play time. A lot of the boomboxes in this price range have a horrible hissing sound when anything playes over the speakers. This is thankfully not the case with this one. I love that it is small and light so I can easily move it from room to room. Also the remote control is a wonderful feature!</comment>

    <comment>I purchased the Canon 40 Ink Cartridge [black] from a Best Buy store and found myself more than pleased with the general price and later quality when I brought it home. Pricing was competitive--reasonably cheaper than other stores. The result of my printed documents was clear and precise----very pleasing. The sales clerks within the store were helpful. I would most definately recommend that others purchase this product at Best Buy stores in the future. Larew</comment>

    <comment>My Father In Law was wanting a pair of speakers, so being the audiophile that I am he wanted my assistance. So, after driving to several local areas to compare quality and performance. We came back to Best Buy and purchased this pair. Extremely satisfied. In fact these will be the ones I will purchase in the near future for my personal use.</comment>

    <comment>This cd is his best yet. He is a great singer and dancer. I love his music; he's extremely handsome too. I love sexy back, my love; I love all the songs on this cd. Chop me up is fire. The song called Until the end of time is so sweet, its very sentimental and a true love song. Everybody loves Justin Timberlake! I strongly advise that ou buy this cd because you don't know what you're missing!</comment>

    <title>The Man Can Sing!</title>
    <comment>There's a lot to appreciate in this album! Musically and thematically diverse, it stands among the most powerful of this rock singer's 13 album career. Even if you don't know much or anything about Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, or Audioslave, don't be afraid to lend your ears to this impressive record. The material is beautifully crafted, sincere, and original--it's a stand-alone work of art. To fans of Chris Cornell's other works, you'll be pleased to find that the man can still sing with as much force and heart as 20 years ago. Try not to be tempted to listen to this record and only search for sounds that emulate Chris's past work. True, you'll find many musical passages reminiscent of Chris's earlier works, but I think it's best to treat this album as a true original. With each album Cornell lends his talent to, I find something new to really shake up and diversify my musical tastes. I'm confident that Carry On will help you experience the same. New fans should also check out Chris's first solo Album, Euphoria Morning, for another 12 tracks of original art.</comment>

    <title>Okay but you have to give it time</title>
    <comment>After the first hour I seriously asked myself outloud what the plot was in this movie. It seemed to be going nowhere. Toward the end there is a key point where you learn something that changes your viewpoint of both the characters and plot. It was not the best movie I have ever seen but it was pretty original and for that I give it credit.</comment>

    <title>A Must-See Purchase!</title>
    <comment>This movie is incredible! It has everything you would want in a film, an fascinating plot, lots of exciting action, hunky characters and remarkable picture quality. It makes you want to be a Spartan, well I know it sure made me want to be a Spartan! This movie kicks butt and is one of the best movies out there right now. It is a must-see movie!!</comment>

    <title>Dexter: Making Murder Fun Again</title>
    <comment>A great show, would recommend highly. Showtime is coming up with some good stuff that rivals HBO's lineup. I'd never watched these, just went out and bought the set blind, very glad I did. Can't wait until the next season!</comment>

    <title>Excellent Sound</title>
    <comment>I bought these for use with my Ipod after getting tired of earbuds. The sound quality is absolutely superb. Sure, the price is stiff, but it's BOSE. The fact that the cord only connects to the left ear and runs internally to the right ear is a great feature. The case is nice and solid too.</comment>

    <comment>I snapped it on yesterday and ill prolly never take it off. its a great fit! not in the way at all and it is WAY BETTER than tryin to select the letters on the tv using the directional pad! its back light for typing in the dark but when your not using it the light goes out after about 5 sec. if you do any typing at all. even if just to add your credit card number for x box live! you have to get one of these bad boys! well worth the price! comes with a headset and it works perfectly! nothing neg to report!

    <title>Best Show Ever</title>
    <comment>This has to be the best show in the history of television. The whole cast is great, from the head of the household Peter to the talking dog Brian, they are all funny. They have a chemistry that is unforgettable. The Voices for the charecters are so funny and so important to the show. If you like funny then you will like this. And if you like a talking baby that is always trying to kill his mom then this is for you.</comment>

    <title>Beautiful Animation</title>
    <comment>Mushi-Shi is one of those animes that even though you have a continuing main character, each episode has its own little story that involves other characters which will more than likely never be seen again in the show. Ginko (the guy on the front cover) is what's called a mushi master. Mushi are supposed to be life in its purest form, and is thought of as the roots of that world. A mushi master is one who has an extensive knowledge of the mushi, and is capable of solving mysterious cases surrounding the mushi and their effects on different people. The mushi aren't necessarily bad, but most of them harm people as a sort of side effect. Each episode on this DVD is a different story about the involvement of a different mushi with a different person, but Ginko is the one who solves each of their mysteries. Mushi-Shi is a sort of relaxing anime that has a fairy-tale like setting. The animation is really nice, as is the artwork that they use for the cover. If someone needs to have action all the way in an anime, I would not recommend this to them. However, if someone likes a calm storybook-like anime (or can at least be happy even if they are not on the edge of their seat all of the time) I would recommend this to those people. Overall, I personally think that this anime is worth watching. Note: I would actually probably give this anime a 3.5, but since it's closer to a 4 than a 3, I chose 4.</comment>

    <title>Phenomenal stuff</title>
    <comment>This dvd captures My Morning Jacket in all their live glory. And they are simply one of the best performing live bands out there today. Recorded on their Z Tour at the legendary Fillmore Theater in San Francisco, they created themselves a little party in 'the woods'. But the songs are what really matter. Crank it up and enjoy!</comment>

    <title>Maybe I Got a Lemon</title>
    <comment>I was rather disappointed with this Panasonic microwave. The controls and features were great, but it began to malfunction three days after our purchase. Foods were not getting fully cooked, and a couple of times it actually shut off by itself. I originally thought that there was something wrong with the electrical outlet, but an electrician checked it out and found it functional. I returned the unit, but didn't have the guts to try another Panasonic. Best Buy handled the return very smoothly.</comment>

    <title>True to the Man Of Steel.</title>
    <comment>I saw this Movie the day it came out in theaters(And about 5 times more after),and I bought it the first day it came out on DVD.Great Casting,great Acting,beautiful Visuals,Wonerful Music.Every Time I went to see it the movie got applause.If You didn't like this movie that's okay,but you are in the minority.I like the fact the Bryan Singer didn't sell out and make the movie too action oriented(Unlike X-men 3,which was fun,but had more action than story.).I like the fact that Singer made the movie in tribute to Donners two Superman Films,and yet the movie was a sequel within itself and having it's own mysterious continuity for future sequels that are coming.Brandon Routh was worth the long wait for a new Superman Movie,as he Portays Superman as the strong,yet angelic figure that I had always seen him as.It is hard to deny that he has Christopher Reeve's Smile,and his Voice,but he puts his own soft spoken spin on Superman that was refreshing as he was not trying to take too much from Reeves.His Clark Kent is right on the money,as the bumbling,shy Reporter that Lois Lane barley even looks at or barely has the time to say "Hi" to (Which Explains way Lois Lane Herself is easly fooled by Superman's Simple wearing of thick Glasses and three Piece Suits.).Kevin Spacey is so Good as Lex Luthor for the straight out reason that his Character gets darker as the movie goes on.Lois Lanes Son,Jason,is Adorable (Allergies and all).Lois Lanes Fiancee,Richard White, is the man that at first you are hoping has many Character flaws,but turns out to be a good man,who is a hero on his own.Kate Bosworth was great aswell ,but many people felt that her Lois Lane lacked the spunk that was brought to the table by her predecessor Margot Kidder,I feel however that she did a great job as the Lois Lane that is stuck between a rock and a hard place(She Loves Superman,but is so very hurt and Angry at the fact that he left Earth and she had to move on like everyone else,and then boom! Superman is back in her life.)After all she still does Display Lois Lanes Workaholic attitude very well.Another Minor Character that got alot of attention was Kitty,Lex Luthors Girlfriend,who is just so fun to watch for some reason.All the Other Supporting Characters like Jimmy Olsen ,and Perry White are done well.In all the movie is great,and and well Casted.The Actors are phenomenal at showing much deeper emotion going on behind their eyes(Hat goes of to Bosworth and Routh.)Critics and Fans on Average liked it,and some People wanted more action as the emotional struggle going on within went over their heads.Thank You Bryan Singer for not selling out the man of steel with the typical jingling of the keys that most Superhero movie Directors use(Explosions and Lazers right of the bat etc.)This movie has a much deeper scope in the end( As we realize that Superman is no longer alone in the world).Can't wait for the Sequel!</comment>

    <title>Mesmorizing, Irresistable CD</title>
    <comment>If you loved the movie, the cd will blow you away. The acoustic guitar driven tracks mixed with the incredible power vocals and emotionally charged lyrics will leave you wanting more. Piano driven songs are the highlight of the album...a great listen if you also enjoy artists like Damien Rice and Regina Specktor. I listen to this cd when i am happy, sad, angry, or just wanting to relax. One of the best albums this year. As good as the movie!</comment>

    <title>Lots of Fun</title>
    <comment>HEY Y'ALL - this is one JIM DANDY of a DVD !! Super long photo gallery is very nice, with lots of old photos, especially some nice Ruby Starr photos.Memorabilia section shows cool items also. The show itself is fantastic, but a little short. This version of the band was the best, with Jimmy Henderson throwing out some killer riffs. Check out his slide guitar work on "Jail Bait". The film is a little dark due to the poorly lit stage. Only 3 lighting stacks for the Royal Albert Hall stage. Also, there is no Ruby Starr here at all. Those negatives are more than made up for by the energetic performance of the band, as they tear thru many of their best songs. Lots of high-stepping struting from Jim Dandy fronts lots of good ole Southern Rock guitar boogie as BOA shows em how to do it. Lots of fun all around.</comment>

    <title>Fresh Cornell!</title>
    <comment>This CD is a must have for Cornell fans. I feel it really shows his maturity, versatility and ability to take listeners down a new path, while maintaining the constant of 'the voice' we know and love. It is not hard to see (or hear) why Chris Cornell has been a highly successful musician for over 20 years. That kind of staying power does not happen without taking risks and reaching outside a certain comfort zone. On Carry On, I especially enjoy Ghosts, Disappearing Act and Arms Around Your Love.</comment>

    <title>Great Blu-ray catalog movie</title>
    <comment>This is a great catalog movie released on the Blu-ray format. It's hard to believe the movie is over a dozen years old since the picture is so clean and sharp. Also, even though this movie is largely driven by dialogue, the uncompressed pcm track is very nice. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Great TV Series</title>
    <comment>I love this series and the box set will make a great highlight in my collection. I'd recommend this series to anyone who loves true life humor with a raunchy British twist. It beats any laugh track laden American comedy by a mile. Think "the popular HBO drama _ _ _ in the City" meets "Friends" but a whole lot better! Bestbuy's bots won't let me say the "S" word</comment>

    <comment>This is by far the best "girrrrrrls kicking butt" picture I have seen! These girls certainly look hot but don't engage them in combat...unless you want your behind handed to you on a platter!....and then...there's Eric Roberts as the cheesiest bad guy ever! An absolute winner in the popcorn movie division! Enjoy!</comment>

    <title>Fun game</title>
    <comment>I like the fusion between first person and third person view. This is the next evolution in shooter games. Taking cover and shooting from behind cover adds a new dimension to an already bland and saturated field of first person shooter games. A.I in the game is good for most of the time. Your teamates will occasionally shoot out in the open without trying to find cover during intense fire fights, which is annoying. But for the most part they do what you tell them to do and avoid going down a majority of the time.</comment>

    <title>Kind of Repetitive</title>
    <comment>This is really quite a good game, but it has its flaws. First of all, it does get a bit repetitive some of the time. And also, the six-axes is not as good (to me at-least, others like it) as I could have hoped. But aside from those, the game is really quite fun and I would definatly recomend it for a person who really likes games with dragons and a "unique" fighting style such as is present in Lair. In conclusion, you should get this game, but don't expect it to be perfect. Also, it was kind of easy.</comment>

    <comment>Weeds is not only entertaining, funny, and quite enjoyable for any member of the drug/marijuana subculture but is also very smart, offering much commentary on American life in the suburbs, the current political atmosphere in this country, and other mundane quips about a variety of issues. The female lead is both likable and attractive despite her massive character flaws and bad decision making habits. Kevin Nealon is hilarious and very real as the pot smoking councilman in the first season and unemployed adulterer in this season. If you like comedies, drugs, social commentary, or any of the actors involved this is a MUST see.</comment>

    <title>50's best album yet</title>
    <comment>I bought the album on the 11th when it came out and listened to it twice that night. It is definatly better than Kanye West's album Graduation by Far. On Kanye's cd there were only three songs that I considered worth while, the other 11 where terrible. The beats were good, but lyrically they were terrible. As for 50's cd though, out of the 17 tracks on the cd about 13 of them were really amazing!! However four were not really that great. All of the beats were incredible and lyrically, it was his best album. If you are a arge fan of "shoot 'em up" style rapping this album is exactly what you should buy. However if you are more into not real rap but hip-hop, then Kanye West's album is what you should buy if you are willing to pay $10 for about three good songs. I recomend 50's album. OUt of the songs the best are: Straight to the Bank, Curtis 187, Touch the Sky, I still Kill, My gun go off, and Amuesment Park. In other words, if you have the money for the cd, buy it. It is worth the money. I would have paid even more for it really, it is his best album by far and possibly one of the best main stream rap albums of all time.</comment>

    <title>Ok, but not great</title>
    <comment>I purchased this to replace another blender that didn't have enough power. The Oster has got the power, but I gave it 3 stars due to the fact that when you take the glass part off the base and place it on your counter, it seems as though it could easily topple over. The base of the glass is narrow and not very steady when it's off the base. I ended up returning it for a Cuisinart that has a wider base and the same amount of power.</comment>

    <comment>I have all of the Family Guy seasons and this one is the best. Not only is it unsensored, but it has the best episodes from the first part of season five on it. Volume five has the best selection of episodes, but if you like classic family guy style, you should either buy volume four or season two. But this box set has the best selection of episodes that kept me laughing all day!!! And they are much better than most other shows seasons too. Buy this box set!!</comment>

    <comment>This will be the Blu-ray that you will use to impress all of your friends. Looks excellent on 1080p plasma. 4 discs provide hours of entertainment. Be warned that some of the footage is not in High Def. I guess they were limited in some of the shots. The majority is HD, though. Wait until you can catch this one on sale...pretty expensive and hard to justfy price even though it is a "must-have" for Blu-ray owners.</comment>

    <title>The REAL premier.</title>
    <comment>Finally, after so many years, Tekkaman Blade finally gets a worthy release in the USA. It's initial release in the early ninties on the UPN network, and at a time where very few viewers could watch, pretty much made sure that it would fall into obscurity, especially with all the editing made from it's original concepts. First of all, the price is just fantastic for a collection of this size. Sixteen anime episodes for $20? That's unheard of! Having so many episodes per volume also means less shelf space being taken up. Second, this series is a fine addition to any mecha fan's library. Featuring unique mechanical designs, fast action, and a story that starts off a bit slow, but picks up the pace as it goes on. The nice thing about this collection is that it's true to the original Japanese release, even to the point that there is no English dub included on the discs. In my opinion, this is no big loss. Plus, the addition of special episodes previously only release in Japan is a nice bonus. Lastly, Tekkaman is an over ten year old series, and it shows. The colors are somewhat dull at points, and the animation isn't as fluid as some of today's anime. One low point is the music, especially the opening theme. While done well, I kept wanting to hear the original opening created when the series briefly appeared on US television. All in all, a great purchase. Those who enjoyed the edited version released years ago will enjoy watching the original version. Although, you will have to read the subtitles if you don't understand Japanese, but for anime fans, it shouldn't be a problem at all.</comment>

    <title>Love X-Men, you'll love this</title>
    <comment>Ever wanted to see a live action TV version of X-men, other then the cartoon. Well this is about as close as you can get. Everyday humans, find themselves with unbelievable powers. And just like in any hero flick, some use their powers for good and others use them for evil. Heroes is packed full of extraordinary characters and by the end of season one I guarantee you will have your favorite. The only question pending is will your favorite survive to face off in the final battle of good versus evil?</comment>

    <title>Good variety of music</title>
    <comment>The thumpin' bass is always fun to crank up on my truck speakers. The collaborations with the likes of Nelly/Justin and even Elton John demonstrates Timbaland's risk taking with other genres is very successful. One of my favorite is track 12: Bombay. The Indian lyrics blended well with the bass beats.</comment>

    <title>Great PSP Game!!</title>
    <comment>This game was built for the PSP and it shows. When I purchased my PSP, this game came with a high reccommendation. I had played the original Syphon Filters on the PS1 so I knew what to expect. But I got more than what I bargained for. The graphics are top notch and the story is awesome. The difficulty isn't too hard, but it makes it worthwhile. You get to play as Gabe and his assistant in various missions. You also get to give commands to individuals during certain missions. If you want a good action adventure game to get the feel of the PSP, buy this game. You use just about every button in the game. The game flows at a good frame rate. The load times aren't too bad either. I have an original PSP but if you have the new one, it should load faster. This game really lets Gabe be the MAN that we know he is.</comment>

    <title>Ample storage</title>
    <comment>I travel a lot and wanted a durable and lightweight, but somewhat simple and straightforward case to transport my laptop in. This product fit the bill perfectly! The laptop storage compartment is tight and well-padded, providing exceptional protection for the computer. IN addition, the case has a lot of useful storage spaces for basic office supplies and paperwork. For the price, this case packs a lot of value.</comment>

    <title>Awesome Coffee Maker</title>
    <comment>This coffee maker is the best thing next to sliced bread. I bought mine with the intention of replacing our old coffee maker. With the variety of coffee that this machine handles and the different flavors, you can never go wrong. The first night after opening it and following the simple instructions, I had used 2 of the 18 trial packages. And trial doesn't mean lacking flavor. Each K-Cup was as good as the last one. There are always draw backs to everything however. This product wouldn't work in a household that goes through a few pots of coffee a day. And it won't be cost effective either to put this in a household that drinks large cups of coffee, the biggest home version only allows 11.5oz of coffee and once you start stretching the k-cups to fill 11.5oz the coffee starts to get weaker. However if you have time, and love to enjoy coffee than this is the machine to get.</comment>

    <title>Extremely high details</title>
    <comment>This game is the most detailed flight sim to date! Beware the hefty requirements to see these details - recommend a Radeon 2900XT series or Nvidia 8800 GTX or GTS to keep up with it. You should also consider a flight stick for maneuvering. If you like flight sims and have a good machine (dual core, 2GB RAM, high end video card) then you should definitely get this game.</comment>

    <comment>I honestly love this show. I have watched it since it first came out and have enjoyed watching them grow up, especially since the characters are close to my age. My younger sister loves this show too. It hits a lot of sensitive subjects but they do it in a very real manner so its easy to understand and connect with the characters.</comment>

    <comment>First do not buy before you rent. This movie is not worth buying. It's about a assassin who releases a bunch of snakes because the witness is on the plane and is going to testify against him in court. Not really a plot to be a replay in your DVD player.</comment>

    <title>Best Unplugged Album EVER!!!</title>
    <comment>This unplugged album is truly one of the better Unplugged sessions I have ever seen/heard. This tops Bon Jovi's, Staind's, Korn's, etc etc etc! I tried to make a mix CD with most of the songs off of this unplugged CD and some of my other favorite Alice in Chains songs, but i found it very difficult to remove any of the songs from my burn list because every single song is great and has it's own individuality! Which is a very good thing! I would definitely tell any rock fan, whether you're into metal, soft rock, grunge, strictly acoustic stuff, and even the surrounding genres, to buy this album and i'm willing to bet that if they have any taste in music at all, then they will LOVE this album!</comment>

    <title>Fantastic Show- Okay Finale</title>
    <comment>Half-alien, half-human hybrids, fantastical powers, threat of intergalactic war- whats not to love? Apparently a lot- at least that must be why the show was cancelled far too early. The ending is very abrupt and sort of comes out of nowhere. Too many questions brought up earlier in the show are never answered and we never really get a chance to leave the planet . . . come on, the show is about aliens! However, despite the somewhat disappointing series ending, the third season does have a lot of great parts. Humans developing powers- that was a fantastic twist. All in all the thrid season was good, but expect to be left hanging with more questions than answers.</comment>

    <title>SOON TO BE MY FAVORITE GAME</title>
    <comment>I preordered my copy of halo 3, about a month ago. The game I think will be the game of the decade unless microsoft comes out with halo 4 before 2010. But until then I think it will be the greatest game.</comment>

    <title>good headphones, not long lasting</title>
    <comment>so i bought these headphones couple months ago. They were great. You get 3 sizes for your ear size and a traveling case (not very useful because it is very hard to put it in the case. ) here are the pros and cons Pros -comfortable -comes with various sizes -lightweight -has a volume adjuster on the wire -excellent for exercising. Cons -The biggest con is that it is a not long lasting mp3 player. I used it for about 2 months, then one of the ear bud sounds went out. YOu have to put the wires in a certain way to make both of them work. Then eventually, my left bud died. So i went online for the lifetime warrenty, but skullcandy never replied. Also, this con is very very common. I know several people that went into the same problem with their skullcandy -The bulky volume adjuster is almost useless. This headphones are great if they are like $15. I know for sure that the price tag went up on best buy. If you wish to buy these head phones consider the following -You have confidence in skullcandy for the lifetime warrenty -You find a really good deal for these headphones (under 15) -You know you can take really really good care of your headphones and know that your not going to run into the same problem as me. -You need great workout headphones.</comment>

    <title>Resistance is futile...</title>
    <comment>A. Adobe Photoshop is the king of photographic management software. There is no serious competition. B. Adobe Photoshop Elements is a subset of the features available in the full product at a much more attractive price. Most users will not miss nor know what to do with what's omitted. C. Immediately after installation, your computer belongs to Adobe Photoshop. I love Photoshop Elements for editing, and improving my digital images and creating interesting photo projects. I can take a marginal picture and turn it into a professional quality shot with the help of the hundreds of adjustments and filters. But man, does it take over on your desktop. Because it takes a significant amount of memory, loads much more slowly and a number of other reasons, I wish I could only use photoshop when I want to use photoshop, but it usurps the camera download, the photobrowser and many other reasonable alternatives that come with Windows. You can still get back to them, but it takes work.</comment>

    <title>He did it again...</title>
    <comment>Kanye West just keeps making good music. In this album he has a lot of expectations. He exceeds those expectations with singles like "Can't Tell Me Nothing" and "Stronger" that have that kind of cockyness that Kanye is known about. Other songs on the album like "Good Life" Feat. T-Pain and "Flashing Lights" pump up The College Dropout. Of course you cannot compare 50 Cent and Kanye West because they have different type of music. I bought both. I think that Kanye has that hip-hop/tecno and 50 is just rap. I would buy it, eyes closed.</comment>

    <title>Perfect Sci-fi movie</title>
    <comment>I saw Serenity before I watched any episodes of Firefly. It had me laughing and cheering the whole movie, though. I have since bought it, as well as Firefly, the complete series (4 discs, one season). I can't believe this show was canceled. Get it - you won't believe it either.</comment>

    <title>50 Curtis</title>
    <comment>I bought this album with Graduation. I can't compare the two. They are two different types of music and production. 50's "Curtis" is of course never going to be like "Get Rich or Die Tryin'", but songs like "Man Down", "Fully Loaded Clip" and "Curtis 187" really bring out the rap that few have now. Singles like "I Get Money" and "Ayo Technology" Feat. Justin Timberlake, Timbaland have gotten radio stations spinning 50. If you don't like rap and 50's past albums don't buy it, but if you like a little bit of rap and 50 sometimes go get it because it's not going to disappoint.</comment>

    <title>Disturbing...ly Good!</title>
    <comment>I had high expectations for this movie. With all the analogies between Disturbia and Rear Window (1954, Alfred Hitchcock), I just had to see it. My high expectations were met, as Shia's performance shows maturity in comparison to his past work. If I could sum this movie up into one word it would be: Promise. Promise that Shia has the ability to crank out more thrilling and believable performances. This movie definitely goes on the shelf... after one more viewing!</comment>

    <title>ATV Series Just keeps Getting Better!</title>
    <comment>I have been playing the ATV series since the first one. This one has everything that you would need, and more. I love the new track editor, although it would have been nice to have more than one choice of scenery. However, the ability to create a track, and then race other people with it online makes for endless racing potential. The replayablity is huge. I could do without some of the cutscenes in the career mode, but overall this game is well worth the purchase. This one will stay in my collection!!</comment>

    <title>The King</title>
    <comment>T.I. showed the people that he was the King of The South in "King" in this album he did good. I think he could do better, but with songs like "Big ... Poppin' (Do It)" and "Help Is Coming" are well produced and nice lyrics. Then you got the songs like "Raw" and "Show It To Me" Feat. Nelly where he tries, but disappoints. I got the album thinking it was going to be another "King" or even better, but he plays it safe and releases a good album.</comment>

    <title>Good purchase</title>
    <comment>I love the cosby show and this is a good season except for the format of the dvd. The DVD automatically has closed captioning turned on for the episodes. So you have to turn it off each time you turn off the dvd before you watch an episode. Also there is no play all feature so you have to play each episode one by one. i prefer the formats of season 1 and 2.</comment>

    <title>Mini-game POW</title>
    <comment>Carnival idea is cute, and the redeeming tickets for prizes/collectables for characters is funny. Liked the boardgame'esk quality to games &amp; events. Liked mini-games options/feature within game play and variety of combinations of players 1 to 4. Like that you have the option to choose how many spins per game to play, after 5 to 10 rounds some of the games seems to drag though.</comment>

    <title>Amazing CD</title>
    <comment>I had already downloaded parts of this album over the internet and after having heard only three songs, I knew I had to get this. I decided to go ahead and buy the physical copy of the CD instead of download the rest. Oh my gosh, this album was worth every penny and then some. Anyone who likes music will go insane for this album if they hear it.</comment>

    <title>Amazed Again</title>
    <comment>THE SHINS...what thoughtful and refreshing music they produce. I can't get enough of it. .................................................................... This last album took a while longer to draw me in; at first, I was disappointed with the songs because they did not capture my attention as immediately as those of the past two CD's. However a couple listens have completely remedied that. I have now become completely addicted to "Wincing the Night Away". .................................................................... They have continued the spiritual journey from "Chutes too Narrow", their 2003 release, with wonderful songs composed with up-beat acoustic riffs and dreamy synthetic sounds. BEAUTIFUL vocals, great beats and lyrics...The Shins never cease to amaze me.</comment>

    <title>Grey's Anatomy Rocks!</title>
    <comment>For anyone that has ever watched this show, they know once you started watching it you couldn't let go. This show is brilliantly created. Even though this show is considered a drama, it is also hilarious at the same time. I recommend people who heard the hype about this show, that aren't currently watching it, should start watching it. This may be one of those girly shows, but even a guy, like me, enjoys watching this awesome show. The acting is great. I see why they won so many awards. BUY THIS DVD SET NOW, with all the other seasons too!!!</comment>

    <title>Lost is Amazing Addictive!</title>
    <comment>I can't wait for season 3 of Lost to come out on DVD. I will be one of the first people at Best Buy to get it. I watched the entire season on TV, but I want to buy it to rewatch it. It is brilliantly created. The seasons keep getting better and better. Many people wonder why I watch this confusing show, they just don't understand the whole meaning behind it. I'm completely addicted to the show. I'm tuned in all the way to the end, no matter if it starts to fall apart towards the end. Buy this DVD set and all the other seasons!!! It's worth the money!!!</comment>

    <title>This game makes an Xbox worth buying</title>
    <comment>Halo: Combat Evolved was one of the first games that I owned for the Xbox, and it was the game that truly made my purchase worthwhile. In addition to the single player campaign, this game is hands-down the most enjoyable Xbox game to play with my friends that I own. If you have even a mild taste for first person shooters and sci-fi, then this classic is definitely for you.</comment>

    <title>It's 'aight</title>
    <comment>I like a coule tracks on here that you won't find on other disks. Most of the cd is extremely low-fi, complete with the hissing of a tape. but that's probably the best they could do due to the quality of the originals. Not for everyone, only the big nirvana fans.</comment>

    <title>Let's go to Prison....OK.</title>
    <comment>I thought this was going to be just the dumbest movie ever. But it wasn't. It actually had some plot. I loved it. It was funny and not too much unnecessary rudesness and language. I'm not sure if I liked it so much because I thought it would be so bad and I was pleasantly suprised or if it really was that good. Give it a try....</comment>

    <title>A star is born</title>
    <comment>In his first starring role, Eddie Murphy does a great job as a wise-cracking cop that is trying to solve his best friend's murder. Classic comedy that started off other roles for a funny black cop, and a saga that is threatening to come back.</comment>

    <title>a strong third album</title>
    <comment>kanye latest efforts are hit and miss for me but a nice ablum to check out and add to his collection. i liked more than half of this cd. kanye's lyrics remain on point but some of the beats miss the soul from the last previous cds of his. this cd is probably better than any of cd released other than common's finding forever. But the production on that one was by the genius himself</comment>

    <title>incredibly funny series!</title>
    <comment>"Mad About You" was always one of our favorite sitcoms while it was on air and this 1st season DVD is extremely funny. This show always seemed to be overshadowed by other shows on NBC like Seinfield or Friends, but, in my opinion, just as good. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Not a bad job</title>
    <comment>This stayed close to the comic book but not close enough for me to give it 5 stars. I was disappointed that they did not use the voice actors from the JLU (justice league unlimited) series. I missed the voice of Luthor that I had grown to love. Overall it was a good movie to watch but comic fans might not like the fact that there were no members of the Justice League there to help Superman as there were in the comic.</comment>

    <title>Great investment</title>
    <comment>My husband recently purchased this lens for me after I had done much research on it. Our children are in sports and I wanted to be able to get that shot that everyone always wanted and it is working. We have another digital camera that is only a point and shoot and it does take good pictures, except it can not even come close to this lens and the quality of pictures it takes. This is a must have item with the Nikon digital cameras. It is a little expensive, but in the long run you will be happy that you have it. This lens is is easy to use and is pretty self explanatory. You do need to read the accompanied instruction booklet if you are not familiar with this sort of lens. I read it over and over!!! I would highly recommend this product for the up close and personal pictures of your children for sports or just for the simple every day pictures that you want to keep forever.</comment>

    <comment>This movie was great. You all know the storyline by reading the synopsis part. Superb dialogue, excellent acting, and a good amount of gore. You will start too feel for the bad guys in this movie. Sid haig is amazing as Capt. Spaulding, Bill Moseley is amazing as Otis, and Rob Zombie just flat out does it again. Amazing!!!</comment>

    <title>Great for Biz School</title>
    <comment>Bought the HP Platinum Edition calculator 5 or 6 weeks ago based on recommendations from the Dean of the Biz school I just began. Have been able to use the built in functions several times already and avoided having to open up the laptop and use excel or other application to complete assignments. Unit is very light, durable, great response from keys, and the flexibility to do RPN or algebraic is great. My only beef at this point is the higher than competition price tag.</comment>

    <comment>This headset is a great one. I broke the one that came with my system and still just got the replacement. The wire is kind of annoying to have around but i have heard alot of bad things about the wireless headsets. Is a great product but didnt get a 5 because it seems so fragile.</comment>

    <title>Halo 3 is GOD!</title>
    <comment>From first impression, and my absolute unrelenting attention to my fav. seriese, this game is an automatic 5 Stars. If you've followed the story arc, then you'd know that Master Chief, main character, is set his course to Earth, to gaurd it from the incomming and present threat. Master Chief has gone through a lot in his course of time, from Halo to Delta Halo, and now back to Earth, only Bungie knows what's in store for us, but we'll all find out on Sep. 25, 2007, when the greatest game of all time streaks into the hands of millions of faithful customers and geeks alike! Enjoy Halo 3, and try not to let it plunge your grades... it might do so to I, so I am hoping I don't get in trouble &lt;,&lt; b</comment>

    <title>Greatest...Disater</title>
    <comment>The game of tomorrow we heard and what we found was something beyond measure one of the more faulty titles to the 360. I have made a small comparision with the pros and cons of the game to kinda get both sides. Pros- The idea of Online Multiplayer in Fantasy Rpg Great Item System Cons- Horrible Lag leading to fustrating play in EVERY match Awful character mouthing as in NPC actually looking like they are talking Way too formal in dialogue lots of thous also no emotion in charater speech Grahpics=Terrible for this "next gen game" This game has so much it could have done to improve on mianly the simple things it seems that this was a rushed title and that not much time was truley put into it and sadly i must say i dont expect the company to make a large profit from this game.</comment>

    <comment>At first when I played Oblivion I did not get what was going on. There is so much in the game that you always lose the main plot of the game. I've seen people that put more than 700 hours of gameplay into Oblivion and still have plenty of time to put into the game. I started the game again and i cannot get enough of it. There is so much to do it seems like forever untill you beat everything there is to offer. I recommend this game because it will keep you entertained and also takes a very long time to beat...</comment>

    <title>My son likes the music I like!</title>
    <comment>My family is very musical and my husband and I have been trying to get my kids involved for years but my son was never interested until this came out. All of a sudden some of the classic guitar songs (some were oldies when we were growing up!) are considered cool - and we are also learning some of the newer songs! Thanks!</comment>

    <title>Another Great Season!</title>
    <comment>As with season one, I have very few to little complaints with the actual episodes of the show (because it's awesome!). Actually, this season's DVD release fixed all of my main problems with the first season. The menus were easy to access and didn't take several seconds (that seem much longer than normal seconds) to load. Also, they have added scene selection! In conclusion, although this set doesn't have any bloopers or deleted scenes, the menus and disc content are wonderful. That's about it for those who only care about the quality of the discs, because the next paragraph is SPOILERS. Stop reading now if you don't want to know. *SPOILERS* So, what happens in this season? Atlantis successfully stops the Wraith siege on the city in a rather amazing way (I'm not telling you how, you'll just have to see it yourself), but loses a valued team member in the process. Said regular does not die, but goes insane and runs away. Now it wouldn't make much sense to just leave a gaping hole in the middle of the cast now would it, so the writers invented a new character called Ronon Dex (Atlantis's version of a rogue Teal'c). Again, I will refrane from giving you too much detail on his character, you'll just have to buy, rent, or borrow the set (or even read the transcripts or check your library...). The mid-season cliff-hanger features the return of our lost insane friend whom I mentioned earlier. Of course, there are several more adventures before you get to the last three episodes. By the time you finish "Michael", you'll know that we can turn wraith into humans (and apparently vice versa in "Conversion"). In "Inferno", we get to see a sweet super-volcano eruption and see the Atlantis team get a new starship called the Orion. Finally, in "Allies" Michael returns and we learn that the wraith can feed on each other. That's all for today's annoying review, I hope it helped (at least a little)!</comment>

    <comment>I loved the tv show and I just can't stop watching the DVD's. It's nice to be able to watch the episodes without the commercials. The extras have a lot of cool information on the production.</comment>

    <comment>With his career in trouble, Martin Lawerence was asked by Eddie Murphy to co-star in this funny movie about two guys accused of a murder that they didn't commit, but yet they get life. Just a funny movie with a cast of charactors that will have you doing one-liners all day</comment>

    <title>Perfect for pictures</title>
    <comment>This SD card (I own numerous) is amazing because it is reliable cheap. It stores huge amounts of photo's (and even video) and it does this at a ridiculously low price. I have used it many times as a "flashdrive" for storing papers and homework on in times of need. I have a reader right in my laptop so it is the only memory card type I would ever use. It is small, and it is so easy to pull out and replace in your camera. They are easily lost, but you can buy cases to store them in.</comment>

    <title>GREAT MOVIE!!!!</title>
    <comment>I thought that this movie was going to be horrible. However, if you liked 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Red Dragon' and 'Hannible' you will definately enjoy this one. This actor does an excellent job, and the story told is great. I won't say more than that because I don't want to spoil anything. If you have the other movies in your collection this one is a must. I rented it first because I thought it was bad- what a waste, I bought it the next day!!!!</comment>

    <title>Text you later</title>
    <comment>Another must have accessory for the Xbox 360, makes entering data for texting and redemption codes easier and quicker. Also a great idea to have it attached to the controller, otherwise you would have to put the controller down and hunt for the message pad if it was independent. I don't know if Microsoft reads these review, but I do have a suggestion that I would like to see. Implementing the use of the message pad in various games. A game like Command and Conquer, where the numbers on the message pad can be used to assign various grouping of troops. Assign a group of Zone Troopers to message pad 1, then all you have to do is press #1. Or in games with more spells than buttons on the xbox 360 controller, assign some of those spells to the message pad, so on and so forth. Again, just a suggestion. In closing, another MUST HAVE BUY!</comment>

    <title>Better than Okay but less than 4 Stars</title>
    <comment>If your a WWII FPS fan I agree that this should be in your library and in your console from time to time. If your not too into the realistic aspect of shooting this game is for you because your an instant "crack-shot" from the start. It's pretty amazing how easy it is to put down the bad guys, but the game is kept interesting by the number of bad guys your up against. If you want a great FPS WWII game pass this one up and go instead for "Medal of Honor Airborne". It makes far better use of Xbox360's power- graphics and game play of MHA truly blows this game out like a handful of grenades dropped at your feet. The shooting in MHA is far more realistic too, making you earn your kills and skills. I still recommend this game because it's fun and intense and the price is great. I don't regret buying it. Finally, if your considering Call of Duty 3, read the reviews first. Based on them I chose Call of Duty 2 over 3 even though the price was the same. Can't comment beyond that because I haven't played Call of Duty 3 accept for the demo which didn't give me the motivation to rush down to Best Buy.</comment>

    <title>Worth Watching, not buying</title>
    <comment>I doubt there is a bigger Cosby show fan then me. But season three is just weak. And it's because Phylissa Rashad(Clair) was pregnant and only in a few episodes. Her character brings a specific atmosphere to the show and when she isn't there and it's not possible for her to be there, the show misses something. I'm not saying that there are no good episodes. But unlike seasons 1,2 and 4 you can't just put these in your multiple DVD player and let it fly. You'll get bored very quickly. Rent this one, buy the other three seasons!</comment>

    <title>It just iWorks!</title>
    <comment>Now that iWork has a spreadsheet application (Numbers), there is no more reason to use Office. Granted the applications are slightly different that the Office versions and so there's a little learning curve, but they are ultimately much simpler to use and much, much more flexible. The documents you will create with iWork are so much more beautiful that you won't be disappointed. And you can't beat the price. If you're a mac user you really ought to try iWork '08.</comment>

    <title>Awesome game, no lie!</title>
    <comment>This is a great game for several reasons. It has many of the nastalgic characters of the original Mario game. But don't be fooled, THIS game has AWESOME graphics, mini games, and you can even play with a friend....even if they don't own the game! And the best part is (for me, anyways) is that a person who is not a big gamer can still handle THIS game with ease! Totally great buy!</comment>

    <comment>Like Bruce Campbell? Like Hercules and Xena, but don't have time for a 40 minute episode? May I then suggest Jack of all Trades! Witty, and just a bit cheesy, Jack Stiles The "Daring Dragoon" (played by Bruce Campbell) Is our Bumbling Hero . Another great show from our friend Sam Raimi.</comment>

    <title>What can I say...?</title>
    <comment>This game is extremely well created. With its creative plot and great action scenes, this has to be one of the best FPS's out there, if not THE best. If you haven't picked this game up yet, I recommend it because you can't beat this price for the gameplay value Halo holds. You never get tired of being able to own your friends with multiplayer and co-op works extremely well on Legendary.</comment>

    <title>Even bad pizza tastes pretty good...</title>
    <comment>So, NO it is not as good/elaborate as previous versions. It is not supposed to be. It's just an expansion of the prior version. No new charachters, no new stages, no new axes, no behind the scenes unlockables, etc (for the most part this is true, some minor changes). The reality is that the new songs ROCK and as always a ton of fun. A definate purchase!!!</comment>

    <title>Hilarious!</title>
    <comment>It had been a while since I cried at a comedian's performance. What Jeff Dunham is able to do is just amazing and incredibly funny. Of course Walter and Peanut are the best, but the other puppets are fun to see. The outtakes alone are reason enough to buy the DVD. Don't miss his new one "Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity" when it comes out!</comment>

    <title>The Animal In You!</title>
    <comment>Pitch Black is an awesome start for the Riddick chroicles, this movie is filled with action, SI-IF &amp; horror! This movie is one that will take you on a ride through the universe &amp; back again! I would recommend buying this movie because not only was it a great story to see on the big screen but also a new idea on the future as well as the SI-IF universe!</comment>

    <title>Good Story, Great Acting</title>
    <comment>I'd not been the biggest fan of Ryan Gosling until I happened upon Half Nelson. He is phenomenal in the role of a drug-addicted history teacher. Newcomer Shareeka Epps is also great in her role. Anthony Mackie is always good and is definitely consistent here. The movie may move slow for some, but there is plenty to appreciate about it.</comment>

    <title>A Live Vision of the Gods!</title>
    <comment>Led Zeppelin was a group that seemed to be bigger than Rock itself during their heyday in the 70's and even into today. They have always been lacking on concert footage that you could get your hands on but with this release you get a glimpse of how truly powerful they were on stage and off, as interviews and a couple of promo videos are also included. From their beginnings to their end you can watch as Led Zeppelin transforms into the ultimate Rock Gods. You will see their early performance on Danish TV up until there final concert in the UK at Knebworth in 1979, which is the most brilliant sight and sound concert you will ever lay your eyes on. As a fan of Zeppelin or just anyone in general this purchase will allow you to slip away into a better place as you watch the greatest Rock band of all time as they grow before your eyes. This is a must own for anyone on this planet who has the breathe of life in them.</comment>

    <title>MUCH better than standard Ni-Cad</title>
    <comment>I've owned a Panasonic KX-TG2730S cordless phone for several years now, and have been through several batteries. I would always buy the standard Ni-Cad batteries, and if I left the phone off the charger, the battery would die fairly quickly. I decided to give this NiMH battery a go, and I'm glad I spent the extra money. The charges last MUCH longer, and the phone doesn't suddenly and mysteriously die like it did with previous batteries. If you need a new battery for your phone, don't waste your time on the cheaper ones. This one is _totally_ worth the extra money.</comment>

    <comment>This is an excellent show, and I was glad it came out on DVD so soon. I never get tired of watching GA episodes over and over again so I'm glad to have the DVD version now! The extended episodes are really great and may be even better than season 2's 4 extended episodes. Great show to watch for anyone who loves romance, drama and comedy all in one!</comment>

    <title>The Chronicles Continue !</title>
    <comment>This Moive picks up where the first lift off, bridging the gap between Pitch Black &amp; The Chronicles of Riddick! This was made by the same poeple who introduce us to the animatrix, not only did they do a great job in that but they did the same for this movie as well! I would recommend this movie to others because it is a big part of the saga &amp; is a must have for all fans!</comment>

    <comment>It works ok. I've noticed the cartridge tends to stop printing, even with ink in it, later on in its life. I guess it dried up? If you can use up all the ink before this happens you should be fine. lol That's a bit of printing though.</comment>

    <title>Encouragement 4 Difficult Times</title>
    <comment>This is a good album. A very strong first release. "Let Go" is performed well and not over produced. The song is written and performed from the heart. "I Wanna Be Where You Are" is great. Once you play it - you will play it again. I would have liked to have heard more style diversity, like a song with medium reggae groove, but I like this album. I even purchased one for someone else. I expect more good things from this artist.</comment>

    <title>The Best Anime Saga</title>
    <comment>I've been anxiously awaiting the release of this incredible saga in season boxset! The day is finally here! Fullmetal Alchemist Season One is the beginning of the amazing journey of two young brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elrich. The two began following in the father's footsteps and studying the science of Alchemy at a very young age. With their father gone, all they wanted was to make their mother proud. But when their mother became ill and died, the two boys broke the number one rule of Alchemy.....they tried to bring their dead mother back. Edward loses his arm and younger brother, Alphonse, loses his entire body and risks being pulled to the other side of the gate forever. Edward sacrafices an arm and is sucessfully able to attach Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. So begins the boys' journey to right their wrong and restore their bodies to normal. Along the way they encounter war and evil beyond their wildest imaginations. This anime is one of the best ever made. It will pull you in and won't let go till the heartbreaking in. If you don't feel for these two boys while watching this anime, you simply don't have a heart. This DVD includes the first 4 discs in the 13 disc series. There is also a bonus episode that any fan just cannot miss.</comment>

    <title>happy halloween review</title>
    <comment>I loved this movie from the day it was released back in the 70's. I bought this dvd just to give as a gift to the people who were going to see the new remake with me and they loved it and had lots of appreciation for John Carpenter and Deborah Hill the director/producer of this classic movie. There is not alot of gore or blood in the movie it leaves alot to your imagination. You will love it if you have not already seen it. "its halloween....everyone deserves a good scare!"</comment>

    <comment>This game just takes some time to get into. Is it as good as Oblivion? No. But it is a very fun game if you give it a chance. Lots to kill including dragons. Has a lot of faults (such as boring quests) but it's really fun just to run around and explore.</comment>

    <comment>Another star in Marvel's crown, Doctor Strange is not their best known character but he's been around for a while. The quality of the animation is very good, the story line is entertaining and it gives you a version of the origins of Doctor Strange. Enhanced for wide screen and in Dolby Digital 5.1, it plays like it's on the big screen. If you like magic and/or superheros I recommend viewing this one.</comment>

    <title>Give a "D" for effort</title>
    <comment>The graphics to Timeshift is something else. I love the fact that the enviroment can be completly destroyed. The time shift effect is pretty cool and also the gameplay moves pretty smooth as well. At times though the game has too much going and and it get's hard to see what you are doing. Also you will find yourself bored of doing the same thing over and over throughout the game.. The story I cannot say much about but for a shooter I can place Timeshift in the same grade as Shadowrun...</comment>

    <title>hello my name is Slevin!</title>
    <comment>This movie was really amazing, one of the best I've see in a while! Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu are just a few of the names of the people who made this movie so good to watch! i would recommend buying this movie beacuse its one heck of a shocker!</comment>

    <title>disappointed</title>
    <comment>I received the box set as a gift because I LOVE this show. But some of the discs don't work. The menu will show up fine but the episodes won't play. Best Buy won't exchange it for the same thing since it's been a couple months. I wasn't able to watch all the episodes before the return policy time period had pasted so I'm stuck with it. My advice is to scan through every episode on each disc as soon as you buy it. That way you aren't stuck with a $200 box set like I am!</comment>

    <title>Amazing Movie</title>
    <comment>This movie is perfect for any movie night your hosting or even just to watch by yourself! It does have a bit of cussing in it, but it is also rate R. It has a great and believable plot, with a couple twists in it. It's not one of those movies that shows unbelievable amounts of gore. I highly suggest buying this movie!</comment>

    <title>The best no nonsense pack I have ever bought!</title>
    <comment>I have had ths bag for about two months now and bought it after reading all the reviews, checking out the Wenger web site, and physically inspecting the product. All I have to say is that it is THE best back pack I could have ever hoped to purchase, and I'm not just giving away this complement, I usually find something negative to say about everything, and in this case it would only be that there are way too many places to stow stuff and potentially lose... that's it and not necessarily such a negative either. The cushion on the bag feel great on my back and allow for air to flow. The shoulder straps are broad and distribute weight comfortably, even with a laptop, accessories, biology textbook and binder filled with notes, labs, etc. The main steel cable reinforced handle feels more than sturdy, and the laptop compartment provides plenty of protection with extra thick foam padding, however, I would never dare test it by tossing it several feet into a grassy field like I did as a kid with my old bags, but feel confident that my laptop would be safe if mishandled and dropped. As one reviewer said this is built like a tank and I agree. Buy one to protect your investment.</comment>

    <title>Funnier than expected</title>
    <comment>After being a long-time fan of the series, I wasn't expecting the movie to be as funny. I was wrong! I had tears in my eyes after only the first few minutes in to it and it only got better. I would suggest this to anyone who needs a good laugh any day of the week.</comment>

    <title>Excellent Quality Discs!</title>
    <comment>I've used Memorex Discs for years and they are the only DVD media that I will trust my data to and the new DL offerings are no different. The discs are compatible with a wide range of players and burners; the burn process is fast (depending on the hardware) and I hardly ever create coasters with this brand. My experiences with Maxell, Sony and Verbatim have been much different: All three produce coaster after coaster after coaster and the ones that do burn to completion won't play on external recorders or develop read errors from dye failure within six months of writing the discs. My experience has been excellent and I give this product the highest rating possible. Remember, the quality of the hardware that you use is just as important as the quality of the discs you use. You use cheap hardware (recorders, players, it doesn't matter); you're not going to get the performance that these discs are capable of.</comment>

    <title>Nick's Back</title>
    <comment>Nick's been aorund for years, but this latest effort certainly feel like a comeback of sorts. Nick is still in a decidely more roots-ey place now than the guy who released THE ABOMINABLE SHOWMAN or JESUS IS COOL. But compared to his last few efforts, AT MY AGE is certainly a more cohesive blend of his earlier, poppier tendencies and his more recent roots-music direction. As usual, Nick continues to have one of the coolest voices in pop music, so for that reason alone, buy this album.</comment>

    <title>BEST CONCERT DVD EVER!!</title>
    <comment>Well, it's the best concert DVD ever, only until Michael Jackson releases one of his extraordinary Bad Tour performances on DVD. Undecided about this DVD? You've got Michael Jackson, the King of Pop, the original and the best. No knock-offs like Usher or JT over here, copying his every move. You've got classic songs, from J5, to selections from MJ's Off the Wall, Thriller, Bad, and Dangerous albums. You've got great singing, great dancing, great choreography, great lighting, and an exuberant and adoring audience of at least 50,000. Billie Jean. LIVE Smooth Criminal. LIVE Man in the Mirror. LIVE Wanna Be Startin' Something. LIVE Beat It. LIVE Black or White. LIVE. and much more! When this concert aired on HBO back in 1992, it scored the highest cable ratings ever. And if you've never experienced a Michael Jackson concert, you just HAVE to check this DVD out.</comment>

    <title>Great Fresh Game</title>
    <comment>Guitar hero is one of the better games on the PS2. Its truly a joy to play and has a completely fresh feel all game. Its not like other music games in that it actually has good songs. You start out and, well, you could say everyone starts from the beginning just like actually learning the guitar. Each song has different skill levels and definatly different speeds, so the learning curve is really exciting and fun. You'll rock out on songs from Jimmie Hendrix's Spanish Castle Magic, to I love Rock and Roll by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. Fun from beginning to end, this is a great buy.</comment>

    <comment>As a graphic designer i do have a powerful mac in my desk, not to mention, an ipod, and other gadgets, and a great library on my itunes for years of ripping all my CD and analog collection into Itunes, well the sound was poor and I was ready for some good speakers without sacrificing any space, after some research, I decide to give this speakers a chance, what a great decision, it seems that they are properly calibrated since all you have to do to achieve great sound is play with the equalizer on your computer, and perfect, for the price, and the size, great speakers for my computer, I tunes happy!, my ipod happy, not to mention the music videos from youtube!!! you can't go wrong with these!!!!</comment>

    <comment>Adobe photoshop elements is the only software you should use to enchance and edit all your photos.; It is definetaly worth the price and takes only 10 minutes to understand how to use it. I HIGHLY recomend this brand over all others.</comment>

    <title>don't be left out</title>
    <comment>Halo 3 beta was pretty decent. Although the final version of this game will be better than what the beta was. It's called a beta so they can make the final tweaks. If you enjoyed halo 1 or 2 in the least bit then you will want this game. There will be a 3day free trial period for those without an xbox live gold subscription so they can try out all the cool options. 4 player online co-op and edit your own maps to play! Doesn't get better than that in a fps.</comment>

    <title>Best Classic</title>
    <comment>The best classic you can get for your entire family and I mean ENTIRE family. Watch Drew Barrymore's first movie and see her as an adorible little girl. This movie makes you want to be a kid again. It's heart-breakingly sad, yet phenomenally uplifting at the same time. This movie will touch your heart, even after watching it for the 15th time!!! Enjoy and don't be suprised if you shed some tears.</comment>

    <title>Great game!!</title>
    <comment>Rainbow Six Vegas really has the trifecta of this style of games in place. First you have the campaign which starts you out in bland dry Mexico (starts out very boring if you've played GRAW or GRAW2) and brings you all the way into Las Vegas. You fight within Casinos and on the streets. You also control a small squad which has very good A.I. and easy controls. As you fight your way through the terrorists you will notice the awesome graphics (and if you play enough, the ever changing posters and advertisements throughout the levels). Secondly, you can play or co-op either on the same TV or over x-box live. For Co-op you can play through the same campaign which is definitely very fun to do with a friend. There is also a mode called T-Hunt, or Terrorist Hunt which you have a set amount of time to kill all the terrorists in the levels. I recommend online co-op for this one and not split screen because it is a lot easier to kill 25 terrorists with 4-8 people then with only 2 (in this mode you can only die once, no respawn). Thirdly, there are online matches. A lot of different modes from the normal free for all death match to the more tactical and skilled saving hostages. Also, holding the briefcase for the longest time and more. You rise through the ranks as you go and get the ability to upgrade and customize your own character as you play through the online mode. You can even take a picture of yourself with the camera for the Xbox 360 and make that the face on your person. During all game play types the game is mostly First person, but you can cover behind walls and either "blind fire", or come out and aim and shoot. This mode is in 3rd person mode. Either way it blends together in a very easy to learn and easy to control way. Achievements are great in this one, a huge variety for all different modes; you will find a few easy medium and hard ones to get. (For an easy one buy or borrow the camera, you get 30 points for taking a picture of yourself with it) All in all I would say this is a must have if you like first person shooters or tactical infiltration games. It's got the best of both worlds combined. I strongly recommend this game.</comment>

    <title>Finest version of Dracula I have seen</title>
    <comment>The BBC produced the finest version of Bram Stoker's Dracula by doing something truly radical, they stuck to the book. They respected the source material enough to avoid the temptation of expanding Dracula's presence, a flaw prevent in many adaptations. This is a disk worth the purchase.</comment>

    <title>same 'ole</title>
    <comment>this is the same ole 50 cent. some good beats on here though and probably 2-3 solid songs that you can listen to with replay value. dont expect anything special but its the second best cd out besides kanye's. for a cd to have 2-3 solid songs is good these days. get kanye then get 50.</comment>

    <comment>I've fixed hundreds of disks with this product and it's great. Most of which would not play anymore. The only thing is You will need 2 buy the AC adapter 5.00 + 2.95 S+H from Digital innovations. Orded form comes with product. Or you will use lots of AAA batterys.</comment>

    <title>Best season of this show!</title>
    <comment>As a whole, this is the best season of "Curb" for sale. Following the theme of Larry trying to both have a successful debut on Broadway and claim his 10th anniversary present his wife promised him before they got married: if they made it ten years, Larry has the right to sleep with someone else, guilt-free. This season is just so much more cohesive than the others. I always want to watch all 10 episodes in a row, because it goes together like a long movie. A great starter season if you are looking to get hooked on "Curb"</comment>

    <comment>Ever wonder how Hannibal Lector got so messed up? Well here it is folks, no more questions after this one. Excellent story line in this movie shot in the traditional classy Hannibal style. Going from a young Hannibal in the middle of World War 2 on the Russian front to his early adulthood, you will be left with shivers running down your spine. Another movie that leaves you wondering what kind of a mind comes up with this stuff?!? Deffinately not for the kiddies. Not my favorite in the Lector series but a superbly done prequal.</comment>

    <title>Best Show on TV Right Now</title>
    <comment>And I couldn't wait to get it on DVD. I had the episodes from the first two seasons permanently DVRed, but now I can free up some space since they're finally on DVD. First episode I ever watched was "Charlie Got Molested" and I couldn't stop laughing and was instantly hooked. If you're a fan of over-the-top outrageous comedy, you'll love this series. And if you've already seen some episodes, you know exactly what I'm talking about, so what are you waiting for? Buy "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" on DVD right now!</comment>

    <title>Good Choice</title>
    <comment>I bought this when I purchased my flat screen tv. We live in an old house so we had to add a grounding wire to the outlet for this to work properly. Its nice that it has the green grounding light so you know its working correctly. Its also excellent in that everything plugs in and is easily accessible. I'm much less worried about my tv investment while using this protector.</comment>

    <comment>So I saw these guys on Jay Leno a few times. They are amazing. Their guitar playing is fantastic and they include a rhythm. If you love just listening to the guitar this is the album for you. I was blown away. The DVD is great too. There's a tutorial that I still can't figure out how to play.</comment>

    <title>GTA- the next GEN</title>
    <comment>Glad the folks over at Rockstar Games left the scenarios explosive with details to familiar sites and sounds of New York and New Jersey. You sometimes forget what you're supposed to be doing, just from the backgrounds enticing you to explore even more. That's just from the demos I've encountered so far. Love the story line of new blood from Eastern Europe. Keeps you wondering what's going to happen next.</comment>

    <title>Great Game</title>
    <comment>This game has wonderful game play. But unfortunately for me I played Halo 2 first. The graphics are alright but after playing Halo 2 there really is no comparison. Mulitplayer maps are, for the most part, the ones seen in Halo 2 just not as graphically enhanced. The story of the game is wonderful. I love that you're playing through a story rather than just going around shooting people/things. I would recommend this game to people but only so they could see the story from beginning to end (Halo through Halo 3)</comment>

    <comment>Sound is great. Installation is a breeze. The only disappointment I had is that for the money you spend, I think it should be much louder. When you start to max the volume, you'll notice that the bass cuts out and the highs sound as if they're straining. as long as you don't expect this to sound like their line of home theater systems, then you won't be disappointed. Thanks,</comment>

    <title>Better than any of their main bands</title>
    <comment>Down is a side project with members of Pantera, C.O.C., Crowbar, Eyehategod and other bands. Its based in New Orleans (NOLA). The album is a unique kind of heavy and is way different from other releases, even Down II. Its hard to describe but any fan of rock and metal should be able to pick this up and enjoy it.</comment>

    <comment>No matter what you have heard of this album you really should hear it for yourself. We all know what Cornell can do fronting the big bands but you really have to hear this album to appreciate this musical genius. He has taken songwriting to a new level with this album and he is not afraid to show it. Absolutely amazing and a must have for any Cornell fan!!</comment>

    <title>Fantastic</title>
    <comment>The acting, the plot, everything about this series is great! Like the rest of America, I never gave Veronica Mars a chance when it first aired. I received the series as a gift and watched the ENTIRE first season in, no joke, one day. HIGHLY recommended!</comment>

    <title>Exciting, Fresh Show With Talented Leads</title>
    <comment>I became a fan of Supernatural last fall when a friend turned me onto the show. That seems to be the way with this show. Word of mouth is how most people have to come to know and love it. The best part of this show and the DVDs are the lead actors. They are hunky, funny, and talented. The range in tone of the show from downright scarey to hilarious is what makes it a unique and fun buy. After watching just one episode from Season 2 last year, I went out and bought the first season and wasn't disappointed. I purchased the second season the day it was released. The genre-bending or genre-blending reminds me of the X-Files and there are writers and directors who worked on the X-Files for years who are now putting their hearts and souls into Supernatural. The Extra Features are among the best too with several episode commentaries and best of all Gag Reels from both seasons. These guys are having fun and it shows. I definitely recommend these DVDs and the show if you're into fast-paced, fun, spooky entertainment.</comment>

    <title>GREED IS GOOD!</title>
    <comment>I have loved this movie since I first saw it like 10 years ago. I have rented it time and time again but for some reason never bought it. Now I am glad I waited. The Special Edition comes with a 2nd disc with some good extras. Plus when I picked it up this week it came with a free business card case. I love the free give aways. If you have never seen this movie, it is Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas at their best. Great acting overall. Intriguing plot and story with a slight Dark overtone. I have seen it so many time but still love watching it. As Gordon Gekko would say "Greed is Good" and you should be greedy and pick this up for yourself. Must Own for your Collection!</comment>

    <comment>This CD is a wonderful addition to any Ben Kweller collection. Overall its a bit more mellow than some of his previous works, but that doesnt bother me at all, its actually refreshing and clean. I LOVE "Thirteen" and "Sundress" Overall, amazing album, as all of his are</comment>

    <title>Best Purchase-Worth $$$$$</title>
    <comment>I bought this all in one brother printer last 3 months after couples of researches. I love it. I haven't had any problem with it. The quality of printing of copying is excellent. It's very quiet. It's so convenient. You can also use it as a phone with a speakphone. How kool is that! The paper tray can be extended to hold different sizes of papers. Nothing more to say about this. Just love it. Buy it and see it for yourself. I'd absolutely recommend this super machine to my all my friends.</comment>

    <title>One of the greatest!</title>
    <comment>While I haven't watched this DiviMAX version of the film, I will say that if you plan on shelling out $15 for a great horror film and you don't already own Dawn Of The Dead, then this is the film to buy. First of all, let me make sure you are aware of the distinction between this film and another film called Dawn Of The Dead. This one was made in 1978, the other in 2004. The 2004 version, while a good film in its own right (sorry purists, but it was a good movie), this version, made in 1978, cannot be compared to. George A. Romero has made, hands down, one of the creepiest film events in history with this movie. Not only does the world of the living dead give you the chills, but the groovy shopping mall that a handful of survivors take refuge in, is in itself a character - and you will find yourself being just as creeped out by the mall as you will the zombies. No doubt, gore fans will love this film and hey, if you like story and characters, DOTD '78 has plenty as well. From the dismal hopelessness conveyed in the photography to the poppy mall muzak soundtrack (available on Johnny Trunk Records), George Romero will give you the best scary movie night you've had in a long time. Okay, enough - go out and buy it! Don't show it to kids - unless you want them to grow up weird - like the rest of us who watched this film at too young an age.</comment>

    <comment>I love this CD so much. Andrew McMahon's voice and lyrics are amazing. Every song stands on its own; there isn't a single one I would skip over. Even though it's been a while since the album was released, I still find myself listening to it frequently. I can't wait until Jack's releases new music!</comment>

    <comment>This is a movie that will keep you guessing to the very end. Hugh jackman and Christian Bale show that they are some of the best actors of this upcoming generation, and Michael Caine also puts on a great performance. If you like a good drama about magic, then this is the one for you.</comment>

    <title>One of the Best Sc-Fi Series Ever</title>
    <comment>This DVD collection was the Premise to the movie "Serenity". The TV Series only ran for 1 season before FOX pulled it. The series details the adventures of a group of people who are very different, yet are able to come together and work as a team. Think of it as a Space adventure meets the Wild West. Great series and I would reccommend it to everyone!</comment>

Christina Applegate is still amazing, but the rest of cast is just plain silly. Most of the Frat Pack members make cameo it the funniest part of the movie...Battle Royal</comment>

    <title>If you like awkward British humor...</title>
    <comment>If you like awkward British humor, this is the show for you. But I have a hunch that most Americans will find this series about "extras" in British film-making too often painful. Ricky Gervais is good, but more or less portrays the same character as his role on the British version of The Office. The best part is probably the famous actor/actress they have as a guest on each show, usually portraying that person with some kind of humorous flaw (e.g., Ben Stiller as an egomaniac, Kate Winslet giving advice on talking dirty on the phone). Overall, not bad, and if you liked The Office, probably worth a try.</comment>

    <comment>This is a great DVD. The two best vacation movies on one disk. Who can forget such a memorable road trip as this? Follow the Griswolds on their fantastic station wagon journey across this country. Laughter is a guarantee. And, of course, the laughs cannot stop with just a journey across America. Europe cannot escape the fun of a visit by the Griswolds.</comment>

    <title>Amazing</title>
    <comment>I honestly didnt know what to expect when I put this dvd in the first time. I just kept hearing that I "had to see it". Amazing. Easily one of the most visually amazing pictures I have ever seen. Great story and characters as well. I highly recommend!</comment>

    <title>another good season!</title>
    <comment>The 2nd season of "Mad About You" picks up right where the 1st one left off. It's easy to see why Helen Hunt was a multiple Emmy Award winner and Paul Reiser was nominated (although he never won) so many times as these two work great together. Season two is on par with the 1st season with some classic episodes.</comment>

    <title>Laugh 'til I die!</title>
    <comment>As an animal lover I commend the creator of this show. The 1st season of Due South had the funniest lines ever written for a wolf in the history of television! Although the creator, as a writer of comedy, went on anonymity as a comedian, he did maintain his serious side as this production foreshadowed. The truly contentious relationship between Canucks and Americans has never been portrayed with as much lethargy. As a fact, the Canadian ownership of everything from a national Airline to a home grown conveyance for law enforcement, a horse, is exploited fully. An archetypal example of the use of the "comic foil". If you like sarcasm, you'll enjoy this as one of the best first Seasons ever produced for TV. Too bad about the creator, eh?</comment>

    <title>Best Mario Kart yet...</title>
    <comment>This is the best Mario Kart in the series yet. Not only does it look fantastic, it plays just like 64 Mario Kart (which in my opinion was better than the Game Cube version). But where this game really takes the win, is in its online play. Now you can match up against players all over the world to compete to see who is the best. A must have for any DS owner.</comment>

    <title>Favorite Hair Dryer</title>
    <comment>Conair makes good, reliable hair dryers, but the best feature this one has is the retractable cord. It makes putting it away a lot quicker in the mornings. The foldable handle also makes it nice and compact.</comment>

    <title>Great product for small price</title>
    <comment>Pleasantly surprised with quality. Had originally entered stored for a different brand name tri-pod and was unable to purchase it because it was sold out. Since we were leaving the next day for vacation I purchased this brand instead. Price was very reasonable. Functions are great...from telescopic legs to quick release plate. I was able not only to use with my heavy Nikon D50 camera (with either my 28-80 mm or 70-300 mm lenses I own), but it connected/supported our HDD video camera as well - VERY easy to use. I especially liked the bag included to contain the tri-pod! Over the shoulder strap came in handy several times when lugging beach bag, cameras, sand toys and tripod!! Would recommend - very pleased with purchase after all!</comment>

    <title>Good for me.</title>
    <comment>I am not very good at this game but I love it! I do admit that the controls take quite a bit of time and effort to get used to but I find that is what makes the fun of playing it better. Who wants a game that you can master in a few hours then get bored with it. I cannot get enough of this game. I immerse myself into it and forget my troubles. BUY THIS GAME!!!</comment>

    <title>Best Sci-Fi Film Ever</title>
    <comment>I love this film, this is probably one of Spielberg's best works since Jaws. One of the most amazing, incredible things about this film would be the visual effects because this is not like your typical alien invasion film. Another thing was the fact that Spielberg took some ideas and concept from both the novel by Wells and the 50's movie, but this is not a remake because this film is in a class of its own. This is one of my all-time favorites, a must-have for any DVD collector.</comment>

    <title>DLINK isnt getting any better</title>
    <comment>Well I have had DLink products for awhile and stuck with the brand for the most part. Had a B based router that served me well for awhile. Then got the MIMO DI-634M, which after a year started random restarts. The restarts would then continue like 15 to 20+ in a row, which is very frustrating. Got another DI-634M and 6 months down the road same thing, more restarts. Read a review on the DIR-655 showing it was the best of the new brands of N routers. Got it home and set it up today. Go figure, right of the bat random reboots/restarts, which you obviously lose all connectivity. Same situation as another reviewer had. Guess Im looking at another brand name, and steering clear of any DLINK Products.</comment>

    <title>A Great Season One</title>
    <comment>Grey's Anatomy is a great new show. It is intelligent, witty, and emotional. At first glance, it seems like a hospital drama, but it also provides some great romantic intrigue. You really fall in love with all the characters. This show revolves around great acting and a great story line. This is a great first season and a must see.</comment>

    <title>A metal assalut on comedy</title>
    <comment>I am impressed with how they handled this show. It's got to be one of the best things to come out of Cartoon Network's [adultswim] lineup in awhile. I just love the satirical style and seemingly rediculous plot lines. Any fan of metal music no matter how hard you rock, just alittle bit or death metal to the extreme, will enjoy this show.</comment>

    <title>Great Accessory</title>
    <comment>The 360 Messenger kit is a great addition to the 360 controller. It Snaps in snug into the controller and feels fluid as if it was meant to be there. It does add quite a bit of weight to the controllers, but it feels great to use. My only beef is that when you use messenger, you cannot scroll up and see what was talked about earlier in the chat</comment>

    <title>Well Worth the Money</title>
    <comment>I was a little unsure on buying this game. I heard a lot about it but the video's and screen shots I saw online made me unsure. I ended up buying it and it turned out to be one of the best games I have ever played. It has hundreds of side quests. One of the largest world maps I have ever seen. More caves, buildings, towns and ect you can enter and explore. The option to purchase homes in towns. Guilds you can join. I played this game and got so cought up in doing my own thing that I never started the accual game quest/ story line. I spent well over a hundred hours playing this game.</comment>

    <title>Reliable quality</title>
    <comment>I have never had a problem with these discs. Never made a coaster (or hover craft from my son's science kit). I have used generic ones at work, and about 15% of the time I have a problem. The Verbatims perform well, burn fast, and play reliably in other DVD drives and DVD players. These match well to my external Sony burner (830u). And the +R configuration is better than the -R because of its re-writing capability (but only write once) and improved error handling. I have no complaints, but I will not give 5 stars because I have not yet had a chance to evaluate long term reliability with these. Wait for these to go on sale (under fifteen) and stock up. Highly recommended. 4.25 stars.</comment>

    <title>The best</title>
    <comment>There is no series better than Forever Knight and this cult show is finally on DVD. There are no extras in this set. The extras are basically commercials for other DVDs. Fans of the show and great story telling will love this. This vampire saga has Nigel Bennett, one of the best actors today and Deborah Duchene. The cast is fantastic. This is one of the best acted shows.</comment>

    <comment>Nigel Bennett's character of LaCroix returns from the dead, Nick realizes his love for Natalie, and Jack the ripper appears. This is an exciting season for Forever Knight. This time there are extras such as cast commentries. The writing is top notch this season and the storylines more intense.</comment>

    <title>Hilarious</title>
    <comment>This show is hilarious! The creators have done an amazingly wonderful job tying characters (sorry, caricatures) from different tv shows, games and comics. Just in case you've never watched the show, here is a quick synopsis: 8 characters live in a house with a 1000000 cameras so that every move of their is captured for our enjoyment (perverse or otherwise!) I'll confess I have only ever watched one or two episodes of any reality series, I don't play video games nor read comic books. However, I get the caricatures and who/what they represent. It is definitely a R-rated show (both for content and language) even when it is censored for television ... so make certain that the little ones are out of the house before you even put this in your DVD player. I'm glad that Comedy Central is bringing it back for a 3rd season! Highly recommended for people with a sense of humor and those that aren't offended by strong language.</comment>

    <title>nothing spectacular, just ok</title>
    <comment>Yet another side project from a Blink 182 member. The album starts off with "Valkyrie Missile" which has a never ending intro to it. The song itself has some okay lyrics to it and some good catchy music to coincide. The whole space people talking in the beginning and ending gets rather boring. Some wild electronic sounds appear on "Do It For Me Now" which accentuates the powerful drumming very nicely. Some of the guitar and bass work is also wild; as always Tom's voice is ever so friendly and noticeable. "The War" has to be my favorite on the album for the simple fact it is filled with drumming. Overall, even being a die hard blink fan this album just really didn't do anything for me. There's a lot of music but lack of lyrics kind of makes things move slow. If anything it's a really good chill out album.</comment>

    <title>Awesome Pick</title>
    <comment>I got this game as a present for my birthday this year and I've been having a blast ever since I got it. It's really a great time playing it because it literally feels like your up on stage putting on a show. I recently bought the Encore: Rock the 80's version and so far that one is a lot of fun too. Personally I prefer Guitar Hero II since the music selection is kind of more my style.</comment>

    <title>Soo Funny</title>
    <comment>Here we have another classic example of why Tom Hanks is considered an elite actor. Set in New Yorks' busy JFK international airport Tom plays a Russian national coming to America to complete a promise he made to his dad. But while he's in midair a civil war breaks out in his home country. Unable to return home and unable to get his visa authorized, he's forced to stay in the terminal. But while he's making an enemy of the acting director of security affairs, he meets a beautiful woman, makes friends of the airport rejects, and causes the whole airport to fall in love with him. Great movie with really great comedy. What more could we expect from Mr Hanks?</comment>

    <title>large quality drive</title>
    <comment>This drive has the fastest conventional connection, Serial ATA, which is great. It is also the best when you are looking for the best bang for you buck. It is priced well and has 500gb. It comes with all wires included also. I also used them to setup a RAID once. Works well. Basically this is the best option unless you have the money and desire to get the western digital Raptor.</comment>

    <title>The very best</title>
    <comment>Barnabas and Julia find themselves in the 1990s. The 70s take on the future is worth a viewing. Plus Thayer David plays a very old Prof. Stokes. This volume is great for fans of the Gerard Stiles character.</comment>

    <title>I Cannot Tell a Lie, I Ate the Children !</title>
    <comment>Ok, so the concept of our first president being a cannibal is a bit far fetched. But that's what is so great about this episode and the series as a whole. I won't go into a complete synopsis here (the assumption being that if you're reading this, you fully know what the story's about) but I will say that this was in my opinion, the most entertaining episode of the whole second season. One could honestly argue that the acting is poor, the film doesn't live up to the expectations of the "horror" genre, etc, etc. It's a fun ride though, so get your ticket and get in line.</comment>

    <title>Sounds like it fell a bit short of an earful</title>
    <comment>Don't get me wrong, the concept of this episode was very promising, but it fell a little short and moved a bit too slow for a hour one timeframe. The ending didn't really leave me satisfied because honestly, it seemed rushed. Not one of the stronger ones this season although the acting was decent. I found myself even forgetting this episode existed until I heard it was coming out on DVD. Recommended for completists of the series, but then again, why not wait until the box sets come out similar to those that just came out for season 1? It'll be cheaper and take up less room.</comment>

    <title>Back to Basics</title>
    <comment>I've heard the album and although the Foo's take a step back from the hard rockiness, they prevail with a less ear-piercing, but very affecionate sound. It takes you back to the days of 1999's "Nothing Left to Lose". I would definitely recommend this to the Foo Fighter fan collecting every piece of material they release, like myself. If you're looking for material along the lines of "One by One" or the hard side of "In Your Honor", you might want to preview before buying.</comment>

    <comment>It's so hard to watch Lost because you can't stop. The DVD is certainly the way to go-- no commercials and no having to wait a week for the next episode. I wish they would all be released as 24hr movies... I'd pay to watch that in a theater!</comment>

    <comment>Starcraft was the game to play back in the days. I recently purchased the battlechest, just to relive my childhood memories hah. Not the best graphics, in fact, horrible (obviously) but the fun factor of playing it was worth it. This is a fun game to play from time to time, you'll still get hours of enjoyment.</comment>

    <title>Best Sequel Ever</title>
    <comment>This game is part of a trilogy of trilogies. Everything from campaign (single or co-op) to mulitplayer (system link, xbox live), the joys are endless. It also makes a great jump off point for Halo 3. If you played and enjoyed the first one, this one is definitely a must. If you like shooters, this game is for you. If you like a great cast of characters, a definitive protaganist, and great plot lines, then you should pick up this game immediately.</comment>

    <title>Extremely Funny</title>
    <comment>This movie was hilarious, even though I am not a NASCAR fan. Will Ferrell is the best! He and John C. Reilly make a great team (Shake and Bake!). You don't have to be JUST a racing fan to watch this movie. Make sure you watch the outtakes and extended scenes...I literally cried laughing. I'm not sure anyone would buy this movie just because of the higher resolution on Blu-ray. It is just a good, funny movie to have in your collection.</comment>

    <title>Great movie</title>
    <comment>I walked into this movie having never heard of the TV show and just a vague recommendation from a friend about it. Now I would have to say that this is one of my favorite movies that I own. The way I describe this movie to friends is its similar to what a movie about the adventures of Han Solo would have been like. Great characters that are given lots of personality in the short span of a movie. About the only thing I found to be better lately in this genre is the TV show it was based on.</comment>

    <title>Awesome Adult Fairytale</title>
    <comment>I loved every minute of this movie. I have a penchant for adult fairy tale movies like Big Fish, or adult fantasy movies like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and this movie is high on my list of favorites. The imaginative creatures, the wonderful story, and the excellent performances all meld into one satisfying film. It got its R rating for just a bit of violence and blood, but this is still not a movie for young children. Even though the main message of the film is aimed at children, some of the visuals will surely scare young kids. I guarantee you won't be disappointed by this movie.</comment>

    <comment>Why? Halo 3 will undoubtedly be the best game, ever. However, the standard edition seems like and incomplete game. It doesn't come with any special features, no cool booklets or inserts, and most of all, no AV calibration tool. If you even consider yourself a fan, you will shell out the extra 10 bucks for the limited edition, if not the legendary.</comment>

    <comment>This is of course the sequel to the fabled katamari demacy. Its predecessor was so fresh and new that it basically discovered its own new genre, and now its back just as fresh, random, and whitty. You would not know just how fun it is to go around rolling a ball and sticking stuff to it util its huge, until you've tried. Great fun for all, and you simply HAVE to break down in laughter a few times while playing!</comment>

    <comment>this is shot documentry style but its a treat to see what all the actors have been doing since the store. Jerry Lacy, John Karlen, and Kathryn Leigh Scott are reunited with their castmates. This is loaded with extras and on one single disc. This is great for Dark Shadows fans.</comment>

    <title>Killing a Franchise</title>
    <comment>You will hear alot about this movie killing off the saga of the Aliens, but its not that bad. Its really funny the stages of Aliens it went from being a big battle in space with special guns and than end at a prison with no weapons.</comment>

    <title>If only Sony-MGM did it the way they should have..</title>
    <comment>This series is wonderful. The casting is great, the style is classy, and Bob Cobert's score is perfect. These episodes are the ones that introduced to the world of Dark Shadows, including the original series. What makes this collection worthwhile is the episodes themselves. There are no extras, Sony chose to present the episodes in a widescreen format when they were meant to be shown in full-screen, and the menu art is blas&#xE9;. They could have done far better, but they chose not to. Other than the butchered job Sony did on the release of the series, the series itself is great. I just hope that someday they give this mini-series a proper release, and also produce a soundtrack CD for it. It deserves it.</comment>

    <title>By far, Universal's best release of this epic film</title>
    <comment>Bela Lugosi's Dracula is the only vampire worthy of the name. The film itself is wonderful, but without Lugosi, it wouldn't be anything to shout about. Lugosi makes the movie. He is the movie. But, I digress; the best part of the film itself is the first part that takes place in Transylvania and Castle Dracula. But the entire movie is well worthwhile, especially the scenes between Lugosi's Dracula and Edward Van Sloan's Prof. Van Helsing. It is a great picture that deserves a great deal of respect and honor. This collection is by far the best Universal has put out for the film. There are plenty of extras, commentaries, and goodies to keep you happy for a number of hours. I would recommend this particular release over the others any day.</comment>

    <comment>If this is your first pennywise album then buy the original "purple album", Land of the free, or straight ahead first. If you like those then get this one. Im a huge pennywise fan and have seen them in concert but the three albums above i like better.</comment>

    <title>A great expansion...</title>
    <comment>This expansion seems to have a bit more to it then the previous ones. I had purchased this expansion for my daughter (she has all the expansions) and she can't stop talking about all the improvement in the next expansion. Also, if you purchased it from BB, then you're entitled to a special download item for your game. I'll tell you what....kids just love the ability to role play and this expansion gives them another avenue in which to explore that dream. They can take their SIMS to new places and fantastic journeys overseas!</comment>

    <comment>Far and away one of the funniest and most overlooked films in quite some time. The cast of "A Fish Called Wanda" reunites (as totally different characters, not a sequel) to create this fabulous and funny film that lampoons everything and anything that gets in it's way. You will never look at a zoo the same way again! John Cleese and Kevin Kline turn in hysterical performances that are outragous. Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Palin are excellent.</comment>

    <title>Beware what this doesn't have</title>
    <comment>Be very aware when ordering this product. Several editions of MS Office Home and Student Edition have different programs. Almost all have Word, Powerpoint, and Excel, but the program called OneNote is frequently swapped out for Outlook. Because every one of my instructors require communication by email, and most require submission of papers and work by email, not having Outlook is crippling to this student edition. Just be careful of what you are getting as there are choices.</comment>

    <comment>this game is a fun game. but on the cover it says that there will be airline crew as soon as you park. and it says that there is an airport and terminals. when you land...there isnt any of this at the aiport. the reason i got the game was to fly a plane and pull up to the terminals like in real life. ut that dosent happen. so now im VERY disappointed.</comment>

    <title>2nd in a classic series</title>
    <comment>Halo 2 continues Bungie's outstanding series for the Xbox system. The series doesn't break new ground insofar as it recycles standard Science Fiction ideas including implacable alien enemies, end of the world scenarios, futuristic weapons, exotic alien locations and others. What Halo and Halo2 bring to the table is polish, excellent gameplay and game design. Halo 2 changes the combat model introduced in Halo to include dual weapon wielding, expanded use of the enemy arsenal, and increased immersion in the storyline as you play both the human and the alien side when a civil war inflames the alien hordes. The multiplayer part of the game remains a huge factor as probably the number one reason for Xbox owners to play online.</comment>

    <title>Kitchen Favorite</title>
    <comment>I own several Kitchenaid Products because of their durability, but the food proccessor is my favorite. It gets more use than any other small appliance I own due to its versatility. It's a fantastic cheese grater, and the slicing blade is perfect for cabbage when making coleslaw, or vegetables for soup. Puddings and mousses are a snap. It also works well for mixing pie crust and some doughs. The proccessor can also be a substitute blender if the contents don't contain too much liquid. An excellent long-lasting product that is worth the price.</comment>

    <comment>This is a very good season with many cameos by other celebrities. Look for Ted Dansen and Richard Lewis returning to play themselves as Larry's friend, and also an episode with SNL's Sheri Oteri as a demented nanny who has been warped by Looney Tunes. This season isn't the funniest in the series, but it is definitely worth ownership. This season helps to prove the Larry David (creator of the series and co-creator of Seinfeld) is the undisbuted master of situational comedy.</comment>

    <title>Fun for a new generation</title>
    <comment>I loved these Super Friend episodes as a kid in the 70's and now I can pass them on to my kids! I had to slow down after watching the first 4 episodes in one sitting with my 7 year old.</comment>

    <title>Good but not great</title>
    <comment>The graphics to Timeshift is something else. I love the fact that the enviroment can be completly destroyed. The time shift effect is pretty cool and also the gameplay moves pretty smooth as well. At times though the game has too much going and and it get's hard to see what you are doing. Also you will find yourself bored of doing the same thing over and over throughout the game.. The story I cannot say much about but for a shooter but I can see Timeshift getting like a 7 or 8...</comment>

    <title>Only For Die-Hard Fans Of The Cast</title>
    <comment>I've never read the novel this film is based on, although I am aware of its reputation as being 'unfilmable'. The film clips I saw on tv didn't impress me, so I didn't have high expectations for this movie. I only bought it because I am a huge Gillian Anderson fan and she has a cameo. I had to force myself to watch this DVD. Unless you're a huge fan of someone in this cast and you find it necessary to own every DVD they're in, don't buy this movie unless you're trying to cure insomnia.</comment>

    <title>Great, But Not Outstanding</title>
    <comment>THE ELSE is probably better than TMBG's last two proper full-lenght "adult" albums (THE SPINE and MINK CAR), but still not at a level with the instant masterpieces LINCOLN, FLOOD and APOLLO 18. Nevertheless, it's a welcome return to a slightly more "classic" TMBG sound. Fans and competists should note that early pressings of this album contain a full-lenght bonus disc CAST YOUR POD TO THE WIND, which is a "best of" compilation from TMBG podcasts.</comment>

    <title>i dont know...</title>
    <comment>okay, besides the fact that these people took this idea from guitar hero this game is not very good. first of all, nobody that plays this game will want to be the singer (that is required) Second, the game has a lot of songs that have repetitive beats and harmonies, this means that the game cant be much more than button mashing of regret. And third every one will want to be the drummer, and who wouldn't? This game will inspire many evenings of fighting over the positions and possibly break up your rock band forever.</comment>

    <comment>This joystick is alright. I got it expecting the great quality of logitec but for some reason it feels cheap. And on the descripion it says left hand universal. Its not, it is only for the right hand. But this product is good and is fun. But i would rather have a different one.</comment>

    <comment>If you're in the mood for a creepy serial killer movie this is the DVD for you. This movie features Brad Pitt like you've never seen him before as a sloppy looking killer. Don't expect the gorgeous Brad you're used to, but David Duchovny looks pretty hot in this movie.</comment>

    <title>Excellent purchase for me!</title>
    <comment>I bought these speakers for a little entertaining with friends outside while BBQing and having a few drinks. Turns out,it was a REALLY great purchase. The speakers are excellent quality and they blend in so well with my garden. My company couldn't even tell where the music was coming from. If you want to make a starter investment in outdoor entertainment,I suggest these speakers. They sound great, they blend well with the outdoor environment (they look just like little rocks!), and the are just pretty cool to show.....</comment>

    <title>Wonderful Romantic Movie</title>

    <title>Intense</title>
    <comment>The acting is outstanding. Set design is minimal--most of the movie takes place in a prison cell. Steel Toes follows the story of a skinhead arrested for the murder of an Indian restaurant worker. The movie concentrates on how his court-appointed attorney, a Jewish man, has to break through his own hatred for the skinhead in order to reach him and represent him effectively. While I liked the movie, I nonetheless had the sense throughout that it would work much better as a play. In fact, because of the minimal set design and the superb script, it felt more like a filmed play than a movie. Recommended.</comment>

    <title>Priceless!</title>
    <comment>Studio Ghibli's "Whisper of the Heart" is probably the most different of any of the films they have put out. The setting is placed in present day Tokyo, and because it is based on a manga, the romance angle is the main plot instead of the usual adventure emphasis with romance mixed in. Following the shoujo (girl) anime style, there is no action. In that respect it is similar to "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kiki's Delivery Service", two other great Studio Ghibli films that you should definitely pick up if you don't already own them. ... The story follows Shizuku, a middle school girl, who spends all her time reading fairy-tale books and writing lyrics to songs. She also spends her time wondering about Seiji Amasawa, the name of a boy that appears on every take out card in every book she's borrowed from the library. When she finally meets him, he's not what she expected or hoped he would be like. From there, hilarity ensues, and she discovers that he really is not as bad as she first thought. ... It is incredibly sweet and completely ADORABLE! The art and music is gorgeous and the characters are down-to earth and easy to relate to. It is a great story and a great movie.</comment>

    <comment>I bought this ram for my dad's desktop. He had 2x256 ddr2 400mhz and this ram was able to downspeed to the 400. When I can get another one of these for $40 again, I will. His performance BOOSTED so much and I can tell because I'm kinda a nerd when it comes to computers =). I would recommend it, especially when it's on sale because it's regularly $100 which is really PRICEY!</comment>

They hit on the fan favorites like "Symphony of Destruction", "Hanger 18" and "Peace Sells". Add this to the list of dvds you must see...</comment>

    <comment>A must have for anyone who owns a Wii!! My biggest complaint when I purchased my Wii was how frequently we had to change batteries in the Wii-motes. NYKO has come to the rescue with this fantastic product. It takes no more than a minute to install the custom rechargable batteries and the covers (with grip!) and your on your way to saving money on batteries and always having a freshy charges Wii-mote. There are several non-OEM products on the market that allow you to recharge batteries for the Wii but I think NYKO is by far the best!</comment>

    <title>Not for everyone</title>
    <comment>I have never seen a more disgusting, disturbing, vulgar, vile, repulsive and above all, offensive movie. It is a laugh riot! Funny from beginning to end. But I warn you, you may feel unclean after viewing this movie.</comment>

    <title>Solty Rei Volume 1</title>
    <comment>This anime has a very interesting story about a future-based disaster-ridden city that is divided with poor and rich people. The rich have a normal life with all medical and living standards and the others live away in a poor, slump town with no absolute way of getting any medical or living standards like the rich. Also with technology that can replace a limb or organ with cybernetic parts that can be substituted with real body parts, but with a heavy price just for the operation. It starts off with a man who is a bounty hunter and body-guard for hire who lost his wife due to illness and daughter in a catastrophic accident. He always still believes that his daughter was still alive since they never found the body and every day he keeps searching for her. Than one day when he was trapped in a corner in a construction site with a criminal who was going to kill him a girl dropping from the site stops the criminals attack. In doing so the criminal ran away do to his condition with his broken cybernetic arm and the girl was unconscious when she fell. So the bounty hunter decided to thank her by letting her stay at his place for the night, but in doing so the girl wanted to stay with him since she has no where to go and he keeps refusing. Than the criminal comes back with his buddy in a giant robotic machine to try to kill him again, but in doing so the girl came in to help him and was able to lift and punch the machine into the air and destroying it. With that in mind what's with that girl, how can she do that, even with cybernetic body parts no one can do that. This volume comes with the first 6 episodes, a starter set box, and a reversible volume cover.</comment>

    <title>Fun relaxed sci fi</title>
    <comment>This is an easy going fun sci fi show that doesn't take itself too seriously. It doesn't have the best set or biggest budget but it is impressive for what it is trying to do, a nice hour long diversion. I just wish Teyla was more prominent and used better. And there's just too much Rodney, his character is necessary for technical exposition but they could cut his screentime in half and it would help the show. Season three was pretty fun. I enjoyed the Wraith storylines. All in all thumbs up. But don't go in expecting a ponderoius show like Battlestar.</comment>

    <title>Best Robot Chicken Season 2 Ever</title>
    <comment>I loved the first season of Robot Chicken, and this one is even better. This season has my favorite skits of the show in it, like the one were the Emperor finds out that the Death Star was destroyed. The extra features were funny too. So stop reading this and buy it already!</comment>

    <title>Woest Superman Movie Ever</title>
    <comment>I just got done watching this, the worst of all the DC Animated films. Badly drawn. Lois's chin comes to a point. Superman's face has very odd lines. The animation looks to be several steps down from what you may be used to from Justice League/The Batman/Legion of Superheroes. The makers have an odd fascination with showing terrified children. The violence is over the top and very inappropriate. I know it's PG-13 but kids are going to watch it and there are like several grisly murders that happen just "off camera". You know they were thinking how much can we get away with and still be PG-13. Parents beware. Definitely not for kids. Right to lifers beware. This wins hands down for the most death ever in a DC project. And if you liked the comic, forget this. Veers off and never looks back. It could have been so much better if they stayed true to the source material. Just trash.</comment>

    <comment>Very innovative set-up. A compact arrangement of both amp and sub, with no compromise of power or quality. So good I am considering getting one or two more to complement the one I have installed powering my Infinity speakers for even more low-end sound and punch. Highly recommended, can't wait for the price to go down!</comment>

    <comment>This is one of the funniest movies of all time. This movie has the adam sandler cast without adam sandler, and the movie is non stop joke after joke. If you would like to see the only real movie about video gaming, then I suggest you pick up grandma's boy.</comment>

    <title>Funny</title>
    <comment>This show was much better than the critics gave it credit for. Seth Green is funny in this disturbing tale of puppet show bussiness. There are extras such as puppet auditions and the origina of the original Greg. I really didn't expect extras in such a small box set. Its nice that this set went all out to please fans.</comment>

    <comment>I love Cds that come with a booklet loaded with imformation and pictures. Lets not forget about the music. Both Quentain's theme and Josette's theme are included along with the theme song from the show. There are other treats included in the CD. This is great for any Dark Shadows fan.</comment>

    <comment>This is the funniest cartoon series ever. With Zap, Zoidberg, and Leela these are funny characters. The best episode is the last in this volume where Fry writes an opera to try and win over Leela. Futuram always had excellent music for a cartoon.</comment>

    <title>Give me one more...Laugh</title>
    <comment>The final episode produced for this TV series. Although the first season had the funniest lines ever written for a wolf in the history of TV, this last episode had the funniest lines ever written by a wolf ;&lt;). This struggling series had been dropped by the networks and resumed production with the help of Canadian funding. Maybe the humor is strictly Canadian (law enforcement on horses parachuting from planes), but Leslie Neilsen should leaving you rolling in laughs. In this day and time it's a very funny look at the thwarting of a terrorist plot.</comment>

    <title>Bloody good time</title>
    <comment>Alright the violence is cheesey, but Robert Englund does a fantastic job in the movie. He makes a wonderful, but different version of Erik. The music is better than in most low production phantom movies. The sets are great and the actor fantastic. Jill Shoelen makes a wonderful and lovely christine. Her innocent sweetness is probably the closest thing to the novel's version.</comment>

    <title>Must have for any A7X fan!!</title>
    <comment>I picked up an A7X album,(Waking The Fallen.) There were a few standouts on the album.(Unholy Confessions, I Won't See You Tonight Pt. 1&amp;2.) The more I listened to the album, the more I realized that this band is no joke. Taking elements from metal, punk, and some hardcore, these guys really know what they are doing, and where they want to go musically. The band being from So-Cal, they are not as poppy as other acts from their area. The All Excess DVD, gives you a first-hand look at the band as individuals, the band as a whole, and their roots. I have all there albums, and this DVD highlighted them all. At first, I thought they were a flash in the pan. But, they are more than that. They have originallity,(hard to came by these days.) On the DVD there are tons of stuff on it. Live footage, videos,(with commentary by the band and directors,) and A LOT of interviews with the band members themselves. Which I think is great. It is as you almost get to know each member personally. Look out for the new self-titled CD coming in October. Avenged Sevenfold is here to stay, my friends.So get used to it, and turn it up. They are THE next metal band to go big. You heard it here. You'll be hearing it everywhere soon. Go buy the DVD, go buy their back catalog of CD'a. They will NOT disappoint.</comment>

    <title>Excellant Story</title>
    <comment>I'm always pleasantly surprised with Edward Nortons' performances. Ever since Death to Smoochie I have been a big fan. In this suspense mystery, he does a dazzling performance as a magician who traveled all of Europa learning the craft of illusion. Returning home for his childhood love events begin to unfold in a most disconcerting way. Props to the writers and director of this one. Oh, and Jessica Biel, you're a hottie!</comment>

    <title>Best EC Performance</title>
    <comment>If you are looking for the best Eric Clapton performance on DVD, this concert for the Crossroads Rehab. Center is by far the finest in a long line of concerts on DVD. His guitar playing on this specific show is above and beyond and that speaks volumes due to other DVD concert releases. Apart from his guest, which you will find has artist from the old days to the now days such as Mary J. Blige, Sheryl Crow and the great Bob Dylan, his playing excels due to the cause of this great show, The Crossroad Rehab. Center in Antigua. Along with his band of many years, David Sanborn joins him in many songs. Mr. Clapton's rendition of "River of Tears" leaves you in total amazement and if you are a fan of "Derek &amp; the Dominos", the number "Little Wing" in which he performs with Sheryl Crow &amp; David Sanborn, will leave you in total Awe. I strongly recommend this show even if you are not a fan because the musical performance by "Eric Clapton &amp; Friends" is by far one of the best recorded concert in history. This is the best classic rock concert captured on DVD and you will be nothing less than thrilled by all performers involved. You will also be contributing to a great cause afflicting many throughout the world.</comment>

    <title>satisfying</title>
    <comment>This product is a good companion with the ipod.It has the best sound,no complaints about it.It has a wide range remote.As long as you have some good songs on it,you can powerhouse it for your listening enjoyments.Say your traveling in an RV,instead of watching the terrain change from now and then,apply your ipod to the dock to listen to your favorite songs along with your family and friends.The black color gives it a sleek good finish.BOSE is a good company,they sell earphones and high standard electronics,and not to mention,the sound dock for the ipod.I'd say this item is a must for travelers.</comment>

    <title>Great Series</title>
    <comment>This series is a good one to get. Plenty of Anime Outlaw fights on land, air, sea, and space. The graphics is awesome and has a nice finding the great treasure theme. I only gave it a 4 because of the box it comes in. Not much work put into making it and no extra content in it either. but if your just looking for a good anime series to buy then this is for You.</comment>

    <title>Best Calculator available</title>
    <comment>If you are looking for a calculator that is useful for every math and science class, this is the one. I admit that I love the "pretty print" and "CAS" of the TI-89, but the 84 is a user friendly graphing calculator that all high schools I know about use. It is upgradeable so when TI makes improvements you can download them for FREE. The TI-84 Silver has so much memory and built in apps it is out-of-the-box ready to use and can fit all the additional APPS and programs you may want. The SAT/ACT StudyCards are excellent for preparing for those exams. In my classroom I give students additional StudyCard stacks and APPS like Timer (a stopwatch they can use for various experiments). SciTools APP can even be helpful around the kitchen and garage when I forget who many cups are in a pint or whatever.</comment>

    <title>Good Movie</title>
    <comment>This is a good collection to add to the Ghost in the Shell series. Don't watch this movie if you haven't seen the Ghost in the Shell series or the movie G.I.S. Innocent otherwise you will get lost in what is happening. But if you have then definitely buy this.</comment>

    <comment>Not only was this router simple to set-up but the download and upload speed is incredibly high. The signal from this router covers our whole house without any dead spaces. I have never set up a wireless system but this was actually fun because it was so easy. The price was incredible too considering that this is an N. I would recommend this for anyone.</comment>

    <comment>this is the second album by the chicago area band the shadows of knight. this one has them sounding more like the yardbirds and doing more original material.there still is a healthy dose of blues standards also.bad little woman should have been a big hit.also included are bonus cuts of a couple more of their singles.this band should have been a lot bigger than they were.excellent early hard rock by lead singer jim sohns and the shadows of knight</comment>

    <title>Not Nearly as Good as I Expected</title>
    <comment>After being a fan of the Superman cartoons, I really thought this would be an excellent movie. I was wrong. I have seen episodes of the weekday cartoon that were much better than this movie. The fight between Superman and Doomsday was cool, but the movie died, along with Superman, after that. I was a little shocked by the sensual undertones between Superman and Lois Lane. I'm not sure that was necessary in a movie that looks to be targeted to kids. Overall, this move was okay, but I wouldn't recommend waisting $15 dollars on it. Wait until it goes into the $3.99 bin.</comment>

    <title>Lovely</title>
    <comment>This DVD has trailers and thats basically it for extras. The film is not as great as the play. Emmy Rossum was not the best choice for Christine and her performance was the weakest of the main cast. Even the normally talented Minnie Driver was a disapointment. Luckily Gerard Butler gave a memorable performance as the phantom. If not for his strong scene presence the movie would've been just awful.</comment>

    <title>Chick Flick</title>
    <comment>I normally can't stand Chick flicks but this one is truly entertaining. Women should find it funny. I really don't think men will like it much since it focuses on women's issues. This is a funny and sweet movie. Jennifer Aniston is wonderful as the loser, Olivia.</comment>

    <comment>Belly is a movie about a group of men trying to make as much money while they are living. This is a story of backstabbing, love, pain and Finding your self. It shows what so many people go threw on a regular basis. Its a definite must see for anyone who wants to see and hear the other side of the story.</comment>

    <title>Quality adaptation of a classic book</title>
    <comment>While not a perfect film, this was nonetheless a great adapatation of the classic story. As with all movies based on books, some liberties were taken with the story to allow for better time and flow. Fortunately, these were minor and not too distracting, and the result was a great movie. The special effects and action sequences were outstanding as well. The extras on this disc were not particularly impressive (but then again, I don't usually spend much time on the extras anyway, so who am I to say?)</comment>

    <comment>Almost FOUR years later since season 2 was released on DVD, season 3 comes out. I'm not sure why it took so long as this show has a very good following and was one of the best sitcoms around at the time. Season 3 is very solid with continued great performances by Helen Hunt, Paul Reiser and their great supporting cast. Where's season 4???</comment>

    <title>Thrice the terror</title>
    <comment>The first tale deals with date troubles so its not suitable for children. The first two tales are pretty dull but the third one with the Zunni doll is a masterpeice. This movie really shows off the acting talents of Karen Black. An added bonus is this movie has John Karlen( Willy Loomis of Dark Shadows) and James Storm( Gerard Stiles of Dark Shadows). James Storm is in the first tale and John Karlen in the second.</comment>

    <comment>I heard the album on a website and I have to say that this is album is amazing. The songs are so meaningful. The 2 best songs to me are "I remember" and "Heaven Sent". People say that she cant sing but I think her voice is full of pain and strength. Her voice is beautiful and I would suggest that people get this album. I know that I am.</comment>

    <title>A Solid Purchase For A Wide Variety of Appliances</title>
    <comment>Somewhere around December, I bought this Duracell Charger to use with my Wii Remote. The selling factor for me though was that this charger came with 4 AA rechargeable batteries. How has this purchase held up, though? Just fine. Sure, I haven't been able to charge your batteries as quickly as I would have with a more expensive charger, but seeing as most of the appliances I use (the Wii Remote in particular) only require two AA batteries, alternating the pair I'm using and the pair in the charger has served me just fine.</comment>

You want to see who The S. Pistols, The Clash and many other bands got influenced by? One answer-The RAMONES! Want to dig deeper? Purchase this and purchase "End of the Century The Story of the Ramones". This is True PUNK ROCK!</comment>

    <comment>This is one of the best games that I have purchased for my Wii. My mother and my wife really loved it as well. A lot of the games are quite a bit like the real thing! Amazing! My wife also enjoys unlocking all the extra games. I wish I had more time to play! This game is also an excellent value, being priced at $39.99 as opposed to the typical $49.99 for most other Wii games. I would definitely recommend this game to a friend. In fact, I already have twice! Great game, loads of fun, highly recommend!</comment>

    <title>Funniest episodes in TV history</title>
    <comment>This second season of Curb Your Enthusiasm is the one that did it for me; the season that made me decide that I would henceforth have to buy every season that came out. This season has the funniest episodes per capita. I've watched the whole season 5 or 6 times, and watching the episodes "Thor" and "The Doll" still make me laugh uncontrollably. I think that "Trick or Treat" is the funniest episode of any series in the history of television. Any one would love this as an addition to their DVD collection.</comment>

    <title>Funny enough to buy</title>
    <comment>The first season of Curb Your Enthusiasm is funny in that we get a first look at the genius behind "Seinfeld". We are conditioned very early on in this season how things work out. Larry continuously finds himself in impossible and awkward situations that make us as an audience feel for him. His wife Cheryl and manager Jeff are always scolding him for his seeming lack of manners, but those perceptions may be do to Larry being a victim of bad circumstances. You'll find yourself watching and taking the side of Lary David, a people's champion.</comment>

    <title>A Definite Must See!!</title>
    <comment>Whether you're a Wal-Mart shopper or not, you must see this movie. The movie tells it like it is and clearly explains the economic impact Wal-Mart has made on American life, from issues like health insurance, employee wages, and the "Made in China" label. Of course, it is only one side of the story, and I believe Wal-Mart has made a rebuttal movie of some sort. Still, it's definitely worth seeing!</comment>

    <title>Okay, but fast moving</title>
    <comment>I recommend people to buy this movie. Althought it is good there are some very bad stuff in this movie as well. The things are -Spoilers!!!! -The history about Doomsday is about 5 sec. They made way to announce his name. -The fight against Superman start to fast and thats why he dies in about 23min in the movie. -They movie doesn't make alot of stuff about Superman dieing because he comes back in less then 5-7 mins. You dont have time to miss him. They dont even give you time to show you how Metropollis is without him. -The plot is too fast. They make a better scene about how Superman getting recharged rather then Superman deing. -For unknown reason this movie is called Superman Doomsday when in realisty they dont really involve alot about Doomsday. After Doomsday is defeated they dont even give one word about where he is, what happen to him, or even about when he is going to came back to life. -In the Comics I would believe that Superman would lose to Doomsday because Doomsday defeated the JL, and he was shown to beat Superman up. -The fight against Doomsday is weird, and good at the same time. They only make Superman bleed ones while in the comic he was bleeding all over. Which was why it was believeable. -There are no JL members. -End Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyways it's great to watch. I do recommend it.</comment>

    <comment>Supernatural has everything: great storylines, suspense, two hot guys, a cool car and lots of great songs. Kudos to Kripke &amp; Co. If you're a fan of spirits and demons then this show is for you.</comment>

    <title>Beck's New Era</title>
    <comment>This album is one of my favorites in my entire library which says a lot. If you're a big Beck fan, this album will evolve your taste for his jagged sounds wonderfully. If you're not a big fan of Beck, this album will entrance your senses and force to dig deeper into his other albums. Theres no way to describe the music, you just have to get it. I promise, listen to it, and enjoy it. Every song is crafted very well and each has their own flavor. Stays entertaining for years.</comment>

    <title>Not as good as Grace, but good</title>
    <comment>I really like this album, although I don't think it is as good as Grace. All the songs on this album except for one were previously released on other Jeff Buckley albums, but I don't consider it a Best Of.... because a couple of my faves are not on this compilation. Even so, I was pleased with my purchase. Jeff is good.</comment>

    <title>Cars somewhat disappointing for adult</title>
    <comment>I was expecting to be drawn into this story about whimsical cars with attitude, but there were some flaws which prevented me from entirely enjoying the movie. First, I found the lead character's personallity traits annoying. When he gets taught a life lesson of course he becomes a better person (or car), but this transformation seemed stilted and forced. Second, the number of colorful characters in the story seemed excessive. Quaint instantly recognizable characters are good, but too many makes for a noisy mishmash. This said, there were some really good scenes and devices like the tractor-cows which while not completely redeeming the film, did provide good comic relief.</comment>

    <title>A Must Own!!!!!!!!</title>
    <comment>I saw this movie with my friend when it came out to theaters and it was the coolest movie I have seen this year next to 300. I can't wait until this movie comes out so I could buy it and watch it again since it was so incredible. I'm going to get the 2-Disc Special Edition no matter how much it costs, it's definately worth it. Those who have seen it know exactly what I'm talking about and those who haven't will be surprised on how great this movie actually is. It's not worth to go rent because you're going to want to buy it right away. This will become an instant classic once it's out.</comment>

    <title>Great Movie</title>
    <comment>I just bought this movie a few days ago and I gotta say it wasn't a bad movie. Quentin Tarantino knows how to make movies. It's lame that you have to buy Death Proof and Planet Terror seperately but whatever you get a coupon for Planet Terror if you buy Death Proof. One thing that I didn't like was that it looks like it was made in the 80s or 70s other than that I really liked it.</comment>

    <title>Great Television Stand</title>
    <comment>My husband and I purchased this television stand to go with our 50" DLP television. Our main goal when purchasing a television stand was first, make sure our television would fit on it. Second was that all our stereo, video, DVD, and satellite equipment would fit into it also. All of them fit into this stand. The stand is very sharp looking. We really like the look of the black color. It will hold up to 62" television and weight capacity for the t.v.'s is 165 lbs. So if you have an older model of television and our looking to buy a stand to hold your current model and them transform to a new model of television, this stand is the one to buy. Great bang for your buck. We would recommend this Bush Television Stand for you buyers out there looking for a stand to hold your televisions and all your equipment.</comment>

    <title>Best Sound Around!</title>
    <comment>I bought this system to go with the Sony Bravia,and Harmon tuner, what a combo. Excellent sound and the speakers do not take up any room. I have a fairly small room for this and the Bose has the ability to be tuned to the room size and the exactly where the speakers are positioned in the room. I bought the floor stands for the two rear speakers and they tuck right in behind the sofa and the chair. They were tuned to the Harmon tuner and work great. Nothing wrong with these babies!</comment>

    <title>A must have for true Chevelle fans!</title>
    <comment>Chevelle rocks the Norva hard in this great concert DVD. The three Loeffler brothers hold nothing back for the fine fans in Norfolk, VA. They play their biggest hits such as "Send the Pain Below" and "The Red" but also throw out some lesser known, but still hard driving songs like "Family System." If you like Chevelle, or simply enjoy a hard rockin' full on concert experience, then you can probably already hear this DVD calling your name.</comment>

    <title>Great series</title>
    <comment>A must have for Star Trek fans. Not a fan of the gate fold disk holders (I prefer the newer slim cases), but they do the job. For any TV series boxed set, the strength of the episodes is the most important factor to me, and this is a good season, but not the best. It also includes a fair amount of extras.</comment>

    <title>House Fan</title>
    <comment>I started watching House during the second season. So, I was eager to purchase the first season to see what I had missed. It turned out that most of the episodes had been shown at some point as repeats on tv, but they were still enjoyable. It is also nice to be able to watch everything in order, episode after episode. The only thing that I was hoping for that this product didn't give me was the background story. I was hoping for a story lines and explanation as to how House ended up hiring Dr's Cameron, Chase, &amp; Foreman, but the first epidode starts out just like all of the rest - with someone getting sick. So, I guess we'll just have to keep watching to find out more about the characters, but if you are a fan of the show &amp; want to see the past epidodes, I definintely recommend this product!</comment>

    <title>A Must-See and A Must-Have</title>
    <comment>Jane Froman's voice and musical arrangements have never been better, and Susan Hayward, in a superb performance under Jane Froman's technical guidance, won the Golden Globe award for best actress in the musical or comedy category. The film shows the meteoric rise of Jane Froman's career from her early radio days up through her USO tours after her plane crash and her appearance at the 1945 Page One newspaper ball. This ending leaves some cliffhangers for the movie audience of the year 2007, but the rest of Jane's career, narrated in Barbara Seuling's Froman biography "Say It With Music", provides great reading material to resolve all the questions we have unanswered at the movie's end. The movie and the book together provide the ultimate Froman experience. Buy this movie for a glimpse into the life of America's most beloved female vocalist. Thank you Jane Froman.</comment>

    <title>Quick back up and shutdown</title>
    <comment>I've had this particular unit for over a year now and it has come in handy. It's great for a standard power supply at 300-400 watts. Anything more than that and I"d go up to a more powerful model. It does what it is designed to do and the back up feature is handy too. It comes with the driver cd and cable. This way in a power failure you can save what you're doing and shutdown. I put in a 550 watt power supply in my computer and I still had 15-20 mins. of power with this unit. Plenty of time to back up what I was doing and shutdown. A+</comment>

    <title>WWII, FPS, what else could you want?</title>
    <comment>Call of Duty 2 is an excellent game. It takes you through a few different storylines as different people fighting for the Allies. The World War II storyline is very well done, the environments, the graphics all top notch for being an original release on the Xbox 360. The Graphics are crisp and clean. The Campaign mode is long enough to be worth playing as well. You can change the difficulty from easy which you can run through every level without thinking, to veteran where you can get killed by 1 or 2 hits. The game does reward you for playing on veteran though with its achievements. Multiplayer on this game in my opinion is a little lacking (this is why the game lost a star to me). It seems like there was only a multiplayer added because FPS games are supposed to have them. Not a lot of thought or design put it. You can buy a map pack for it though which I have not played. And there are no achievements for multiplayer. Achievements all come from single player campaign mode. They are very well done; you certainly get rewarded well for playing each level on the highest difficulty with them. I think this is a must have game for WWII enthusiasts or even just FPS enthusiasts.</comment>

    <title>Good for kids!</title>
    <comment>This movie has been played at least 100 times at our house. The story line is really good, and it is a decent length movie to keep kids interested. We give this movie to kids for birthday presents. Not many have it, and everyone ends up loving it!</comment>

    <title>Powerfull motor and the best crushed ice ever</title>
    <comment>I purchsed this blender about 8 months ago. It replaced a very old blender that has worked great for 10 years. I was looking for a new blender that was built well and had options to do many types of blending. This blender meets that criteria. The blender construction is very solid with a very powerful motor. The motor speed system tries to maintain the selected speed even when various thikcknesses are put into the carafe. It sometimes has a hard time blending very think mixtures where you have to help assit the mixture down into the blending blade area. There is a Crush Ice mode that makes perfect crushed ice. All in all I would highy recommend this blender over many others out there. Its worth the extra cost.</comment>

    <title>Heart-Wrenching Story Of An Incomplete Person.</title>
    <comment>Tim Burton's follow-up to "Batman" is nothing less than a masterpiece with a star-making performance by Johnny Depp, a wonderful performance by Winona Ryder and the final film of horror icon Vincent Price. As someone who is disabled and experienced rejection &amp; ridicule, I can clearly relate to the story and how he found love, which he could never requite. Everyone should see this film. If ever you have made fun of a disabled person, I hope that this film will change your perspective. The film is rated PG.</comment>

    <title>Still playing it.</title>
    <comment>Halo is just one of those games you go back to when you've outplayed all the new games out there. It's always fun. Yes, it's not perfect but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives. Halo 2 pretty much made xbox live what it is today. It's the only reason I bought xbox live to play with my friends. There's nothing better. If you've played the game and don't like it then you're either not a fan of FPS games or you're a Playstation fanboy.</comment>

    <title>Great game...but..</title>
    <comment>This was the first that I have really ever played a gta game, and i have to say that it was awesome at first. To me, after a few months, the game lost it's appeal, I would get stuck on one mission or the game's aspects just got boring and repititive. Although i give it 3 stars, avid gta fans might find it more to their liking.</comment>

    <comment>One of the best first-person shooters I have played. Great graphics, and it is just plain fun to play in Vegas. I also really like the online play. There are a bunch of different variations when playing online. My personal favorite is completing the missions with other people.</comment>

    <comment>There are so many amazing songs on this, including their popular hit "I Can Only Imagine." My favorites include Here Am I, How great Is Your Love, and House of God. Almost There is the very first MercyMe album I've purchased and I haven't been disappointed. If you choose to purchase, you won't be disappointed either.</comment>

    <comment>This is a great game. It has awesome graphics, great story line, awesome control, and it has great tactical game play. It is a must have. It only has one huge drawback. XBOX Live. There are too many ways to cheat online to count. If you want good , honest, online play, play with your friends only. Besides that, get the game, it is awesome.</comment>

    <comment>The Time Machine is a somewhat sad movie about a man that loses the love of his life on the day that he asks her to marry him. He desperately tries to develop a time machine to go back and prevent her death. This movie is a great movie to watch with a loved one because it makes you feel save to know that your loved one is so close and nothing can happen to them.</comment>

    <title>One Of The Best</title>
    <comment>Noein is the story of a twelve-year-old girl named Haruka and her group of friends who live normal lives until a group known as the dragon cavalry shows up out of nowhere trying to find the dragon's torque (who they believe is Haruka herself). Karasu, one of the members of the dragon cavalry, claims to be one of her closest friends, Yuu, from fifteen years into the future. As the story goes on, you find out that most of the characters that are in the dragon cavalry (which are all from fifteen years in the future) are actually from Haruka's group of friends (except all grown up and with different goals in mind....). Noein does a wonderful job displaying the hardships that the future can bring (that may be completely unforseen), and leaves you wondering what the fate of the group of friends will be in the end (and especially the fate of Haruka). Simply put, Noein has no weak points whatsoever. The animation is superb (it's a combination of computer animation and regular animation--they're blended together beautifully..), and the music paired alongside of it is great. It has one of the best storylines to offer in the anime world, and now that the whole series is out, you're going to want to go back and buy the rest after watching this first volume!</comment>

This dvd set also includes Doctor Who Confidental, a great behind-the-scenes look at the series. Doctor Who Season One is sure to delight fans young and old alike!</comment>

    <title>Great Add-on</title>
    <comment>This product is a great after-market addition to the wii product line. I have gone from regular batteries to rechargeable AAs with no real improvement because I end up wasting time charging and recharging. This rechargeable station is an attractive solution to those dead batteries. It saves time and puts the remotes in a neat organized holster. Recommended A+++</comment>

    <title>The ONLY choice for wireless TiVo</title>
    <comment>Even though you can use generic wireless G adapters on the TiVos, I highly recommend using the TiVo Wireless G adapter because program and data transfers with it are substantially faster than the generic adapters due to the hardware-based compression the real TiVo adapter allows. This is no small benefit when you're transferring programs between TiVos using TiVotoGo or MRV and you need to move gigabytes of data. It will save minutes per program and hours per month.</comment>

    <title>One of the better Movie-License Games</title>
    <comment>We were actually surprised at how good this game was as a movie-to-game license. The gameplay was very good and the graphics were acceptable. The only downside was that the things the game required you to do to win started out as fun, but were VERY repetitive by the end of the game. This game also has really easy Achievements, for you achievement-mongers on LIVE!</comment>

    <title>Leonidas rules!</title>
    <comment>Wow.. what stunning movie. The story really makes you pay attention, and the visuals are OUTSTANDING. There is slow motion for much of the fight scenes, which is good, because you don't want to miss any of this action. Most of it was filmed in blue screen, so that they could add stylized creatures, and enhance the visuals to the nth degree. I would recommend this film for the action/adventure watching people.</comment>

    <title>Graphics are dated now, but gameplay is solid</title>
    <comment>The graphics are dated on this title, but the gameplay is all Call of Duty, and are a great primer for the intense action and graphical upgrade coming with Call of Duty 4 this November! Nice that the Game of the Year edition gives the fans some face time with the creators of this great series!</comment>

    <title>doesn't last</title>
    <comment>I bought and installed on a friday. I was very happy with the speed and connection strength. I have the D-link extreme router DIR-655. The first problem I had was every time I brought the computer out of sleep mode, the adapter would not come back on. I would have to unplug the usb and plug back in to get it to work and connect. It quit in three days. I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers three times. THe activity light would never come back on. Also the wireless manager software that comes with it never worked either. It always locked up when I booted up the computer. I returned it and bought the D-Link - Xtreme N Wireless-N Desktop Card Model: DWA-552 and installed it today. Love it.</comment>

    <comment>This is a game that you will either love or hate entirely. Personally, I thought this was an awesome game. The only issue I have with it was that it never did a 180 degree turn when I wanted it to (so I had to fly in a circle haha). Other than that, I rather enjoyed it and loved the story plot. The thing I don't understand is why are people complaining that you can only fly and nothing else-the game was meant to just fly on a dragon that's what you are critiquing. If you don't like to play flying games, then you definitely won't like this game so don't even bother buying it.</comment>

    <title>Best Product Bought!</title>
    <comment>My husband and I purchased this Entertainment center. It took a little while to put it together, but the instructions were very easy to follow. We are very impressed by the swivel feature and the quality of the product. This is one of the nicest pieces of furniture we have bought! A MUST BUY!!</comment>

    <title>Underrated</title>
    <comment>Reminiscent of those teen comedies being massed produced in the late 80's/early 90's. Amanda Bynes is just terrific, name another teen actress who's better at pulling off comedy, that girl's a natural. There are some serious LOL moments, more than your average 'teen comedy'. Highly Recommended.</comment>

    <title>Vastly underrated art-house film</title>
    <comment>Don't be fooled by AMG's short-changed star rating of this film. This film is one of Lynch's best yet. Of course, with that said, his films are an acquired taste and this is definitely no exception. In fact, this is likely his weirdest film yet. Have an open mind and be willing to surrender yourself to Lynch's surreal nightmare and your aural and visual senses will be in for quite the treat. A U.S. masterpiece. Dare to see it!</comment>

    <title>A Sobering Look</title>
    <comment>For a true fan of music, you get curious about how a band gets put together. What sustains it? With this dvd you get alot of answers. Some times you find yourself wanting to look away. Being a huge RAMONES fan while watching this, I ached for the guys. As all good stories go, there's this side and that side of it. The producers interview past members of the band as well as pulling together interviews of late members. This is an incredible story. This is worth seeing.</comment>

    <title>Best of the Home Business Wireless Routers</title>
    <comment>Purchased product on Sat Sep 22nd. Exceeds my expectations - very fast on Comcast.net. Easy to use with Network Magic (included in box), Secure product access and the out of the box product works great. Installation instructions are not in the Box, You need to print a PDF file and ensure that you use the links to get online documentation to make this work. Invested 10 hours in config of Wireless notebook, 3 desktops, network printer, securing it all. This product is great and it really works. You MUST upgrade Firmware to latest version, and you must upgrade the Router Config Utility and Network Magic to latest versions to get extreme results. D-Link need to improve the Getting Started instructions in box. This is NOT for an inexperienced / new user.</comment>

    <title>Great Movie</title>
    <comment>Knowing how talented Bruce Willis and Mos Def are I expected this movie to be good, but was shocked at how much better than expected this movie turned out to be. I have to say that Mos Def stole the show as his level of acting was much higher than other musical artist you see featured in films. This movie provided a touch of comedy, a lot of action, and decent dose of drama making for a great movie.</comment>

    <title>Absolutely Hilarious</title>
    <comment>I kept hearing about how good this movie was and read all the reviews and finally I said, "All right all right, I'll check it out!" Let me tell you, the previews didn't do this movie any justice. This movie was so funny that my stomach was in so much pain afterward from all the laughing. This was definitely one of those movies that caught me by surprise at how over the top it was with its humor. Andy has to be the text book example of a true 40 year old virgin and watching him trying to remedy this problem is just way too funny....mainly because of what his co-workers at Smart Tech put him through. If you purchase this movie, you won't be sorry as it's one of those movies you can watch over and over again.</comment>

    <comment>For the longest I wouldn't watch this movie because I felt that the visual style used in this movie was a knock off of the God of War video game visual style (and still do), but was finally talked into watching it and all I could say was, "Wow!" This movie was ripe with action and a lot of heart making for a really nice surprise.</comment>

    <comment>I read all the reviews, then went out and bought one. It was incredibly effective for stains I had tried to get out before, and the carpet simply looks new. The hand tools are effective as well, and the unit works much better than "heavy duty" units I had previously rented at Home Depot, etc. I was going to have my carpet done professionally, but I bought this, saved over $100 compared to the professionals, and can do it whenever I need to.</comment>

    <title>Great Sound with great price</title>
    <comment>A couple months ago, I decided my replace my aging Sony cube speakers with a mid-to-upper range system. I walked into Best Buy with the mindset that I needed JBL's. I started listening to them and was impressed but started thinking about the amount of money it was going to cost. I started looking at other options and these Sony's were next to them. A buddy and I swapped back and forth from the Sony's and the JBLs, which cost 2-3 times more. Neither one of us could figure out a difference. I actually found the Sony's to give a fuller sound. Needless to say, I walked out with a pair and have not though twice about it. The money I saved allowed me to upgrade my center speaker which is also a Sony.</comment>

    <title>Relief!</title>
    <comment>I would consider myself a large fan of HIM. But let's be honest with ourselves, 'Dark Light' was far from the album we were anticipating. After their American exposure, I wasn't really expecting much from Venus Doom either. Luckily the CD didn't disappoint! I've been listening to this in the car for the last couple of days, and it's a pretty catchy cd. It's easily not their best work, but at least they improved over their last album. I do recommend this cd. Especially for HIM fans.</comment>

    <comment>I was very pleased with the purchase of this stand. I had purchased a different stand from Best Buy for my parents and found this one so much easier to put together. I would definately recommended this to anyone looking for a TV Stand.</comment>

    <title>So Awesome!</title>
    <comment>Re live the 1977 world series, Every pitch and call. Leading up to the coolest game ever, game 6. No sporting event was more classic and it defined the 70's. Howard Cossel calls a classic with his native NY accent, perfect for the NY championchip, in NY, during the crazy year of 1977 - in the Bronx no less. fans swarming the field after game 6 was legendary.</comment>

    <title>must have for any gamer</title>
    <comment>--I've tested the game and it's UNREAL--by far the best FPS and will lead the industry for years to come--Beta Testers were letdown earlier this year, but everything has been drastically improved. Graphics, Gameplay, Matchmaking,Achievements -4-way CO-OP campaign mode via splitscreen/XBOX LIVE---Topping what GEARS OF WAR did --GAME SAVE FILM &amp; SHARE feature is out of this world. Kick some royal butt online, save and share with anyone on XBOX LIVE. Grab the popcorn men, because you'll be replaying your top online matches again and again --Regardless of this game being launched on a platform that has underpeformed with the 3-RED LIGHT -"Ring of Death" have no fear. Microsoft has stood behind their product TWICE for me. At no charge I've had my 360 replaced and back in working condition within 10-15 days. If this is holding you back from buying a 360 don't let it. I hear all new 360's with a product upc of March 07 or newer are in great shape. --High Def with 1080i highly advised. Not just for the hardcore gamer, but for the fan-base that truly appreciates a work of art when it comes to gaming. ENJOY!!!! ps--don't get Legendary---helmet is a plastic rip-off that faded in the sunlight. Save your $</comment>

    <title>So Much Fun</title>
    <comment>Our whole family loves this game. My husband and I really enjoy how much this game makes you feel like you are really fishing. Even our 8 year old and 12 year old girls enjoy the game as much as we do! I would highly recommend this for anyone that loves fishing.</comment>

    <comment>Jackman has done it again, by bringing another character to life in a different style. The director did an amazing job with the film. Just by bringing all 3 monster characters into one film its amazing. And for those home theater sound movie goers, this is a great movie to blast on your surround sound.</comment>

    <comment>Adam Sandler has done it again. A great funny cast. Alot of people didn't give this film the reviews it really should have gotten. This film is funny from beginning to end. So pick this film up and see for your self. And for those Adam Sandler fans this is a must have.</comment>

    <title>Pretty Good</title>
    <comment>While the party games lack in this title, the single player game can be very addicting. The controls can be sensitive at times but once you get them down it becomes very fun and challenging. Had lots of fun with this game and if you like the series it will interest you as well and the controls are great.</comment>

    <comment>I bought this thing for $40 not that long ago. Fifteen is a steal! It's funny that this is under family movies though cause it's most def not for the kiddies. Sure it's animated but hello!.....there are plenty of animated movies just for adults and this is one of them.</comment>

    <title>It's House</title>
    <comment>If you haven't already seen this on TV, then you probably don't own a television. House is the highest rated show on TV and it blows away the competition. Hugh Laurie is a genius and the show continues to accelerate into the status of legendary television. A medical drama with great twists, sharp humor, and deep characters. House is by far the best show on television. These DVDs are excellent. The format is great and the extras are always a lot of fun. Overall, the menus are simple, you can locate anything you need, this is a must buy for any House fan...like me!</comment>

    <title>Cannot go wrong</title>
    <comment>Why has the design of these not changed in decades? Because it is already perfect. Great look and very functional. Amazing power kneads through thick dough, high speed whips eggs or cream. This solid and sturdy machine is heavy which is a good thing because if you are doing dough, a lighter machine would tip over.</comment>

    <comment>The first season of this epic series is the perfect choice for anyone wanting to take a trip down memory lane to when television had some excellent sitcoms. The cast of "Mary Tyler Moore" is fantastic. This series contains some of the best episodes ever written for television. This collection features the entire first season, as well as some old CBS promos and a "Making Of..." Special. I would recommend this collection to any pop culture or TV history buff, or fan.</comment>

    <title>Hilarious</title>
    <comment>Ok, let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of movies. I have over 300 DVD's and am starting off my Hi-Def collection with Blu-Ray (too bad this isn't on Blu-Ray). Anyway, with that said, this is a great movie. I am a college student and have had my fill of high school comedies. This movie is a little more grown up, which I like. The subtle jokes throughout the movie will keep you rolling, meanwhile, the movie actually has a plot. That is what surprised me about this movie, it actually has a point and it's not just a big laughfest. I'd give this 6 stars if I could.</comment>

    <comment>One word...Beautiful. Yes, she is beautiful, but that's not what I'm talking about. Her voice is just beautiful, but just having a beautiful voice doesn't get you far in this industry. If you love that old school voice with new school sound, than Vivian Green is the voice you want to hear....just beautiful</comment>

    <title>Fans of Jodeci</title>
    <comment>Another Jodeci hit album with combination of all their greatest hits, but they missed couple of my personal favorites. True fans of Jodeci will get this album, because they played out their other albums. Jodeci was the first ever R&amp;B group to have that crossover love from both R&amp;B singers and Hip/Hop artists. Travel back into time to jam Feenin, and their debut single Forever My Lady</comment>

    <comment>Greatness, Ms Badu brings in a new sound that we soon forgot, soul. I just love this album from beginning to end. I just wished she had more songs, because 11 songs (not including the intro/outro &amp; skit) wasn't enough.</comment>

    <comment>This CD is OUTSTANDING. Overlook the first 2 tracks, although they are good, it does not represent the entire album and are actually the lowest points. It's a wonder why she started off like that but she's a powerful vocalist and the album flows nicely. This is going to be a classic!</comment>

    <title>Better than Guitar Hero</title>
    <comment>This came from the original team that made the first two guitar heros and also the karaoke games. So those who think this won't be as good as guitar hero, you haven't read enough about this game. This promises to be a great game, singing is not required, just as drums are not. It is only an option. If you can't sing, and I can't, then don't buy the mic. Unless you just want to make a fool of yourself and just have fun.</comment>

    <comment>This is another combo of villans gone good, a great film from begining to end just seeing two of the most crazy villans going at it is crazy enough.This film was actually enjoyable and also the person behind the fingers (Robert Englund) came back once again to put the glove on for this film, because he said that he is the original freedy and that makes him a true icon in my book</comment>

    <title>Another Gibson Great!</title>
    <comment>Very well done. Mel Gibson's talent for directing almost exceeds that for acting. A great story and a great visual presentation. Definitely worth checking out.</comment>

    <title>Great Investment!</title>
    <comment>This is the very best speaker wire on the market, PERIOD! I have 200 ft. of it powering my stereo and have never had anything better and would not consider buying anything else besides this. The lifetime warranty on this wire is also a plus as it protects your investment in your equipment unconditionally. Thank you!</comment>

    <title>Another one my daughter enjoys</title>
    <comment>I have a daughter that is 3yrs old going on 4. This is a movie she enjoys Its not to long and the music in this she's been singing since she first saw it. There is another pooh movie that would also recommend Pooh's heffalump movie. This is another movie with great animation and music. She been watching that on and off for over a year. This one has a little more intense scenes in it then the other ones. My review is pretty much the same for Pooh's heffalump movie, Piglet's big movie and this one. The only pooh movies that my daughter doesn't seem to want to watch over and over is Heffalump's halloween and the search for Christopher Robin.</comment>

    <title>Not good if you have to work in the Morning!!!</title>
    <comment>"Rainbow Six: Las Vegas" is one of the first games in a long time that I have actually sat down long enough to play. I enjoyed playing the campaign mode and all, but the real magic of this game, would be the Terrorist Hunt mode and the online play. Terrorist Hunt mode is a unique campaign that allows you to go through previously explored areas and take on a huge number of enemy terrorist. This mode is always fun, whether you play alone, or with a friend. The enemies are actually fairly intelligent, too. Though their AI eventually get predictable, they are more than fun to play against. I will also say that if you have XBox Live, you will never get sick of this game! It seems like there is no end to the amount of rank you can earn. Tons of fun! This game keeps me up all night!!!</comment>

    <title>For Martial Arts Fans</title>
    <comment>If you're a big fan of the martial arts, this movie is for you. It starts out full of cheese, but gets better toward the middle. The ending is good, but overall the movie tries to handle too many subjects. Definitely not Jet Li's best performance, but then again, what is? The fighting scenes are well choreographed and enjoyable. Watch the movie for that.</comment>

    <comment>i saw this movie in the theatre and am waiting anxiously for the release of the dvd. as a 57 yr old male i expected a movie geared towards children but was i ever surprised. the movie, while featuring a tremendous amount of action, also has quite a bit of comedy making it an all around enjoyable experience for everyone. a must own movie for any collection.</comment>

    <comment>Well, it's been confirmed. Will Ferrell really is the most unfunny man in Hollywood today. Two creative lines are all that stand out from every other recycled bit of humor in this movie. A waste.</comment>

    <title>Enjoyed every minute</title>
    <comment>Coming soon is a teen coming of age movie that explores the female's side of it. Due to this I thought it was a great movie because most of these types of movies follow guys. Coming soon follows a group of rich girls in a private school, trying to figure out how to achieve pleasure from their experiences. Quirky Ryan Reynolds plays a rich kid trying to hide who he is. All in all a great movie for fans of comedy, teen movies, or Ryan Reynolds.</comment>

    <title>A Great RPG!</title>
    <comment>Oblivion is the latest chapter in the Elder Scrolls series, and I would say it is the best by far. The graphics are fantastic, especially outside of the cities in the forests. There are tons of quests to do, and many paths for your character to take (good, evil, etc), and what lifestyle you choose has a bearing on what quests you have the chance to attempt. There's SO much to do, I know that some people can get overwhelmed because it's not obvious in the very beginning what to do. I just recommend talking to a few people and you'll find your first quest. Because of the branching nature of the game, you can play it four-five-even six times and still not see everything. This version is a little choppier than the XBOX 360 version graphically, but it's still very fun to play!</comment>

    <title>Having a voice just isnt enough</title>
    <comment>Another great album from Ms. Green, yet again mainstream didn't know anything about it. This proves the fact that having a great voice isn't enough, you need to be more sexy. I love this album because she does the exact opposite, she sales love.</comment>

    <title>Poor quality headset</title>
    <comment>The main reason I bought this product was because I needed a headset. For only $10 more I get a headset and the messenger kit, thought it was a good deal. I have nothing against the messenger kit. This tiny keyboard is nifty little toy to have for your Xbox 360, but the fact that you can only use the headset that comes with it is one of the biggest problems. When I used the headset I had a lot of complaints from other players online saying that they are hearing major echo from the headset. Also the volume control is located on the wire itself which is a big problem because its hard to locate half the time. If you plan on buying the messenger kit for a headset, I highly recommend not too.</comment>

    <title>DONT EXPECT FULL PERFORMANCES</title>
    <comment>This is a good dvd, very informational, and includes some cool interviews with Gleeson, the man responsible for the orchestration. BUT, it only includes segments of performances and while the dvd claims to have the only know recorded performance of Atom Heart Mother with the full orchestra, it is only displayed in segments. You can view the entire performance on YouTube. All in all a good, informational dvd on Floyd, but a poor performance dvd.</comment>

    <title>GREAT FLOYD DVD</title>
    <comment>This is an amazing dvd. Not only does it contain the Pulse concert, but it has a few extra performances and extras. The only thing i did not like is the editing. Coming from the point of view of a muscian, i would of liked to of seen less of the projection screen and more of the band. Lots of farway camera shots, which allows you to see the full stage show, but gets annoying especially when you want to see Gilmour busting a solo. Overall a great musical performance.</comment>

    <comment>This flexible mini-tripod is wonderful! Great for use in unusual places, like uneven surfaces. You can easily wrap it around a tree limb, or set it up for a shot on a mountain trail or hillside. Very good price (around $20-25) for a "must-have" for all photographers!</comment>

    <title>Beautiful Blu-Ray Hi Def transfer</title>
    <comment>I got this movie for my wife, but was surprised that I actually enjoyed the comedy in it as well. The bigger surprise was that this movie has one of the BEST Hi-Def transfers I have seen yet. The color saturation and black levels are FANTASTIC. Technically, I'd give it 4.5 stars, but the movie itself is only a 3. Still, enough funny stuff in here to make it easy for guys to watch with their significant other.</comment>

    <title>A new Chris Cornell</title>
    <comment>This is not Soundgarden , Temple of The Dog or Audioslave. This is Chris ,doing his thing. The voice is amazing, as always. There's a variety of music style on Carry On. It changes up from one to the next. From heavy rock to soulful sounds. My favorite song changes from time to time. But. the first one I heard live, off this album, "Safe and Sound" still stays right up there for me. I definitely recommend "Carry On" to anyone. Give it a few listens.</comment>

    <title>Can't get enough</title>
    <comment>Family guy is the best cartoon IMO, it may not have the strongest plots like the simpsons, but I just wanna laugh. The best part of this DVD is that every episode has a commentary. If you ever wondered what inspired the crazy ideas behind each episode you will find out in this volume(obviously only for these episodes). I actually watch the commentaries more than the actual episodes.</comment>

    <comment>This movie played out in theatres last summer. I saw it. Loosely based on the George Romero 60s classic. Lots of great 3d effects, not cheesy like the 3d 80's movies of the past. Pretty good storyline, and very interesting 3d visuals. Actually one of the better 3d films currently released, horror, that is. Looking forward to the dvd version from Lux Digital. Watch for the many Romero injected scenes, ther in the movie, but ya gotta lookf for them! Buy this, or rent it. But, see it.</comment>

    <title>Lawrence of Arabia -</title>
    <comment>Great classic! However, I found quality of the DVD audio track to be poor. I have seen Lawrence of Arabia on VHS tape a few years ago and the audio was excellent and impressive. Unfortunately it was not the case for the DVD version. Someone must have been asleep at the switch when it was recorded on the DVD.</comment>

    <title>"Oh my God it's a good movie"</title>
    <comment>If you like South Park on comedy central then you'll love the South Park movie. When the Boys sneak into a rated R Terrance and Philp movie it causes the parents of south park to blame Canada. So now it's up to the boys to stop this war. And yes it's bigger, longer,and uncut.</comment>

    <title>Here's Jack</title>
    <comment>I really loved this movie, and is one of the reason why I started liking Tom Cruise, if you wanna know the truth-You can't handle the truth. Great line. Demi Moore was good, even with her clothes on. Now Jack was nothing but than great, but did you expect anything less from him.</comment>

    <title>Seen it before</title>
    <comment>Hollywood must be having problems with making original movies because with these sequels, and remakes are getting ridiculous. This movie was done before, as a comedy, you remember Gena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson in The Long Kiss Goodnight. Yes this movie is more dramatic with alot killing, but it has the same plot as Long Kiss just with a male twist.</comment>

    <title>Too Dramatic</title>
    <comment>This is a good movie, but everyone is so use to Vin Diesel playing those nothing-but-action type of movies and this one is more dramatic. Very plot driven, with not that much gunplay.</comment>

    <title>Stunning</title>
    <comment>As we are now losing our living memory of World War II, Ken Burns masterfully depicts not only the battles in foreign lands, but also those fought at home, bringing equal attention to the struggles of the servicemen and their fearful mothers as to the blossoming of industry and the injustices we wrought on our own society through racial biases and discrimination. Ken Burns tells all these stories through four "war towns" that are symbolic of most any town in the US during the war. It is a must see for any person who wants a better knowledge and understanding of the trials, triumphs, sufferings and sacrifices made during this struggle. This will surely become a staple of American history classes of the future.</comment>

    <title>Classic Nightmare</title>
    <comment>This movie started a decade of sequels, and thats before special effects were computerized. This movie made some adults scared to sleep at night, so of course this is greatness. Although it got worse with every sequel being more comical than scary, but Elm Street set the standard for horror flicks.</comment>

    <comment>Funny movie about a woman that is sick and tired of unfaithful men and she has had enough. Martin was at the peek of his career, with hit sitcom and on-demand actor, when he made this funny movie that established Bobby Brown as an actor. Yeah, Bobby Brown was really acting in this movie</comment>

    <title>Not One Let Down</title>
    <comment>I stood in line at 11 pm to puchase my copy of Halo 3. Making it home by 12:30 and popping it in the system by 12:35 I was not disappointed once. The only thing I'm dissappointed in was the reviews I've read from the Press. Not one mention of some of the controls being changed from Halo 2. These changes actually enhance the gameplay in my opinion, but for those of you who were Halo 2 diehards like me, you have some buttons to get used to. For the record I am writing this review after only playing the game for one hour before heading off to bed, but I promise you will not be let down!</comment>

    <title>A calmed down Keyshia</title>
    <comment>Keyshia shows her more sensitive and calm side on this album made obvious by the number of slow songs present. There are many ballads that tend to be more on the Pop side than the R&amp;B/Hip Hop rough and rugged side as we've heard from Keyshia before. Her vocals even seem to be more toned down. Overall, the album is pretty good but if you really liked her first album, chances are you may not be too hyped about this album.</comment>

    <title>Different but amazing!!</title>
    <comment>My husband loved the 1st Showdown cd, I didn't really get into it, then they came out with this one, I heard it and immediately had to have my own copy!! I absolutely LOVE it!! I know its different from the 1st and that might dissapoint some, but I think people need to give this cd a try! Its great metal music with amazing vocals and thought provoking lyrics, what more could you ask for! ( I saw them live for the first time last month and they rocked just as hard with the new stuff as the older stuff) I'm off to the store to buy my 6th copy of this cd, I keep buying them for friends as gifts!!</comment>

    <title>The complete rise and fall of Death Row Records</title>
    <comment>I've been a fan of Death Row Records since 1992, when they dropped the LEGENDARY album The Chronic by Dr.Dre, and later Snoop's LEGENDARY debut album Doggystyle. Everything was all good until situations, planned or unplanned, caused the company to spiral out of control and crumble. Due to the legal problems, Dre leaving the company, and all things related caused Death Row's unfortunate and untimely demise. Now, normally I would review what's on the DVD, so what I'll do is basically talk about how AWESOME and REAL this dvd is, as opposed to giving aways what's on the dvd. The way the rise and fall of Death Row is told here by Suge, Dre, Snoop, Nate Dogg, and others in nothing short of amazing. We start in the very beginning to when NWA was formed in the mid 80s to the end when Dre left the company. All of the information here, I knew some of it before I saw it for the first time. But the information told here that I DIDN'T know before surprised me. @ times during this film, it's SO intense that you just can't help being captivated by the content. Don't believe me? In addition to the individuals telling the story, look @ the eyes of Lydia Harris and Simone Green. As you look @ their eyes when they tell the parts of the story, you're immediately drawn into the emotions of the storytelling. Also, all of the pieces of information are blended together superbly. NO history and incident is forgotten here, and you receive everything you could possibly know about the rise and fall of Death Row Records. Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dvd to any fan, long time fans, new fans, etc. You won't regret this purchase, and like me, after the first viewing, you're going to view this dvd repeatedly. It's just that good. LONG LIVE DEATH ROW!!!</comment>

    <title>Standout Performance</title>
    <comment>This is a great movie, great plot, great cast, and a great director. If you like basketball movies with that gangster attitude, than this is a movie to see. Tupac was great playing a gangster, but was that really a stretch for him. Duane Martin got a chance to relive his dream of playing basketball in front the world, well those saw this movie. Marlon Wayans is even good, but surprise, Bernie Mac steals the show as a homeless man.</comment>

    <title>It was ok</title>
    <comment>This fiml was just ok. They say its a true story but who really knows. It has this love scene somewhere in the middle and becuase of it the film got one less star. Should have had more shooting and action.</comment>

    <title>Great Film</title>
    <comment>The first one was great, the second one was not good so I thought the third would be a dump but it was a good movie and I liked it a lot. I would recommend it and watch it again.</comment>

    <title>Do Not Waste Your Time</title>
    <comment>This film had no point to it and was stupid. I did not find it very funny. This film is for those between the age of 18 and 24. If your under 18 you should not be watching it and if you over 24 you have grown to mature for this movie.</comment>

    <title>Rakim STILL in his prime!!!!!</title>
    <comment>1990 was a FANTASTIC year in hip hop. The likes of Ice Cube, LL Cool J, Brand Nubian, A Tribe Called Quest, just to name a few, all dropped CLASSIC gems that year. Eric B &amp; Rakim returned with the third album, Let The Rhythm Hit Em. This album is as equally great as their first two. Rakim still turned heads with this one, and he and Eric B delivered as usual. Here's the review: Album Highlights: No filler on this album. The album highlights are Let The Rhythm Hit Em, No Omega, In The Ghetto, Mahogany, and Run For Cover. Production: Thumbs in the middle. Not slamming production, but still head bobbing material. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: While it's certainly NOT better than Paid In Full and Follow The Leader, this is still Eric B &amp; Rakim at the very best. This album has classics that are still pumped today. I recommend this album.</comment>

    <title>Great Game</title>
    <comment>One complaint that you will not hear is that the game is too short. There is sooooooo much to do and explore.....I spend way too much time picking flowers (LOL). It takes a little while to get the hang of what you should be doing and how you should be doing it, but it is a lot of fun and hours (literally hundredreds) of entertainment. It is not for people that prefer running through scenes shooting people up, you spend most of your time exploring and collecting. It is worth the money just for the game time that you will get out of it. Especially if your like me and don't replay games often. Once I'm through a game I will trade it in for a new one.</comment>

    <title>Best Xbox 360 game so far</title>
    <comment>I would say this game so far is even more enjoyable than the first two halo's. With the last two I waited til the price went down to snag a copy. Not this time though I watched the count down on G4 and headed right over. All the reviews on G4 said I would not be disapointed and the game shots and maps were great! I don't game all to often I mostly study in my free time. This game is hard to put down though the excitement and action pulls you in! You will be saying to yourself oh I can just play for a little bit but no the solo campain drags you in and the multiplayer is great being able to customize your experience! I may have only had the money to dish out to buy the normal edition but on one dvd it packs a lot of game.</comment>

    <title>Funny than I originally thought</title>
    <comment>I think I was gonna like this movie, because of the fact that there some many PG-13 movies that should be rated R. Now this movie was just great from beginning to end. If you don't like this movie than something is wrong with you. Yeah, Glen is ridiculously funny, but I think the guy that wanted to blow things up with his mind was crazier</comment>

    <title>Swashbuckling Redition Of A Classic Story.</title>
    <comment>In adapting Alexandre Dumas' 1462 page novel for the silver screen, an IMMENSE amount of cutting the extra material not pertinent to the main story (Edmond &amp; his revenge against those who betrayed him) had to be done. I personally applaud the screenwriting of Jay Wolpert (who wrote a script for "Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl" which was ultimately rejected), the superb direction of Kevin Reynolds (who directed the smash hit "Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves") and an all-star cast, including Jim Caviezel (before his powerful performance in "The Passion Of The Christ"), Guy Pearce ("Memento") and the late Richard Harris ("Camelot") in one of his final film roles. Cutting it down to just a little over two hours and maintaining the spirit of the original novel, albeit with a lot of liberties that die-hard purists will not enjoy, that is quite an accomplishment. The movie itself is a tour-de-force. It shouldn't have been rated PG-13 (the brief situation in the movie is handled discreetly and the violence is mild &amp; non-graphic). As for language, come on. It's a period piece. All in all, awesome film. The special features are very interesting: a featurette on Dumas himself, an inside look at the process involved in bringing this classic novel to the screen, deleted scenes with director commentary and more. Highly recommended with Disney's version of "The Three Musketeers."</comment>

    <comment>The game is a little confusing, and slow. Unless you have all four controllers it can get kind of annoying to play, I hate to have to wait for it to play it's own turn. I wasn't too impressed.</comment>

    <title>Best Online Gameplay</title>
    <comment>So I got this game when it first came out and was so busy playing other games that I almost forgot about it. When I finally picked it up I could not put it down. The campaign mode is excellent with good graphics, storyline, and decently challenging objectives. The best part about this game is the online gameplay. There are a lot of different ways to play online from online terrorist hunt, online co-op play, and just for fun player matches. My personal fave is the ranked team sharpshooter matches. Challenging ranks to overcome, I actually got a huge satisfaction of earning the rank "elite" legitimately. This is a great game.</comment>

    <comment>I saw this in theaters when it first came out and I loved it! You don't have to watch this first movie (28 Days Later) to appreciate this movie. The plot is about zombies, but the idea is very original. Watching this one at night is highly recommended unless you frighten easily.</comment>

    <title>Would be great if it didn't lock up</title>
    <comment>This is a great game that both young and old can enjoy.The only problem is that this game locks up and you have to unplug your system every time it does. I have exchanged it and it still does it so I think it's something in the game. It's annoying but I'm still glad I bought it.</comment>

    <comment>This show could have gone on forever. I never got tired of the main characters or the main plot of the show. The only thing to hate about this show was that it had ended!Get this first season! You will get hooked! Lucky for you, the other seasons are out. I had to wait four years!!! You will love the paybacks Jerod hands out to the scum bags he seeks out. Give it a try...And you can blame me when you have to buy the rest of the series! I will wear it proudly!</comment>

    <comment>I don't know why this lens is so cheap here. It's a downright amazing piece of equipment to use during the day, or in very bright situations. I highly recommend a good tripod, but if you have the alpha 100 already then it's likely you have a stand. For the price that Best Buy is offering this lens, I almost bought 2 thinking it must've been some sort of mistake.</comment>

    <title>Best game i've ever played</title>
    <comment>I didn't even preorder this game, becuase i was kinda falling out of the video game world, but when it came out on 9/25 i just had to get it. I brought it home and played for hours. The new surroundings and land design is cool. I especially love being able to rewatch my gameplay and create screenshots. I haven't even played online yet, but have almost finished the game. The only thing i wish they would've done is make the Battle rifle sound louder like it did in Halo 2.</comment>

    <comment>I know this product has been on the market for some time but man Mr. Manson has a lot to say not only is it all about religion don't get so worked up on that please don't. he is just stating in most cases that we don't have or we should not live by something that we cannot see nor hear or feel.....that is just stupid, you might as well worship air. But yes this product is quite the ride I must say and I would encourage people to buy it.</comment>

    <title>Mediocre Effort</title>
    <comment>I was very excited for the new Foo Fighters album. It comes out kicking and screaming with tracks like "Pretender" and "Let It Die." The only problem is that the ferocious pace dwindles more and more as the album progresses. By "Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners" listeners will feel like they are listening to a completely different disc. It almost seems like the band tried to put too many different styles on one disc. Although it boasts a few good tracks this cd is not worth purchasing.</comment>

    <title>If Shakespear could make movies</title>
    <comment>I only saw this movie because of sexy Gabrielle Union, but I ended up liking this movie (and plus Ms. Union didn't have that many lines).</comment>

    <title>Not good</title>
    <comment>Some movies shouldn't have sequels because its not as good as the first one, and this movie is one of them. This movie literally went too far and doesn't even live up to the expectations.</comment>

    <title>Hey you</title>
    <comment>Funny way to spin comedy on the Mafia, by putting a more serious actor with a comedy genius. Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro are too funny together. One of the first movies I seen when Mr. Crystal wasn't the funniest actor in the movie.</comment>

    <title>Good, very kiddie, but good</title>
    <comment>Ok, first thing to remember as an adult listening to this sound track is that its a kids movie. The songs are very geared to kids. That being said, there are some songs on there that could fit in on any of his other albums. True fans of Jack will like this album and fans of Jack with kids that like Curious George will like it even more.</comment>

    <title>Bumtastic!!!</title>
    <comment>This is a great cd. As with every The Used cd, it has a well balanced mix of laid back (using the term lightly) and heavy, hard-core tunes. A couple of my favorites include "Maybe Memories", "Taste of Ink" and "Buried Myself Alive". They also show off their classical style hard-core talent with "Greener with the Scenery". Great cd, definately worth a listen for fans of the heavier music crowd.</comment>

    <title>Berth II?</title>
    <comment>This album starts off with a bang, "Take it Away" is an amazing song that has everything you need to get pumped up for the rest of the cd! They continue on with, "I Caught Fire" (one of my personal favorites) and "Let it Bleed". They keep the music coming with a stream of upbeat fun-to-listen to songs, but then take a chill pill and slow things down with "Yesterday's Feelings" only to jump right back into things with "Light With a Sharpened Edge" and "Sound Effects and Overdramatics". Though this cd doesn't seem to be as consistant as their first, but a great one non-the-less.</comment>

    <comment>You gotta love this movie for so many reasons, but here's three to start you off. One because you have Will Smith and Martin Lawerence acting like cops. Two because its set in Miami, hint sexy women. Three because its funny.</comment>

    <title>HALO 3 - The game every XBOX 360 onwer should have</title>
    <comment>Graphics: Breathtaking 9.5/10 The graphics great. The rumors of an upgraded Halo 2, or Halo 2 like graphics is not true. With smooth framerates and stunning effects, you will be taken aback. Take some time to watch the backgrounds and environments and the detail of that went into these levels. This is after you clear everything that moves. Sound: Amazing - 10/10 The sounds, music, effects, and voices take you immediately into the game. Surround sound is a must so you can hear the shots, shouts, and footsteps of the your opponents in this game. The score for this game heightens you senses, and truly brings you into the game. Gameplay: Spectacular - 9/10 Smooth animations, large levels, smart enemies and A.I., big battles, and 4-player co-op = awesome. Without giving anything away, this is some great storytelling that gives way to some genuine wow moments. Replay Value - Amazing 10/10 Multiplayer. That is all I have to say. This game has high replay value. Choose which way you would like to play online, but with the achievements, future downloadable content, 4-player co-op, and with over 1 million copies pre-ordered, and 4 million copies on retailers shelves in the first week, there will always be someone to play with. Overall - Perfect 9.5/10 I am a fan of First-Person-Shooters (FPS) and all that is associated with them. I enjoy the emersion, and critique them heavily. This game allows you to "finish the fight", but this game is so much more. The campaign brings closure, but it is the multiplayer aspect that will revolutionize XBOX Live and online gaming as we know it. Halo 3 is Bungie's 3-year project and baby, with unlimited resources from Microsoft, that was made to send Microsoft's XBOX 360 to the next level, and it was worth the wait and money. With over 1 million pre-orders, this epic tale concludes with the highest pre-orders of a game to date. This game in campaign feels, and plays near perfect, and allows veterans and newcomers alike to enjoy and truly experience this game. The story line finishes up the previous two games, and is just long enough to make it feel right, and not dragged out. It took approximately 8.5 hours to beat it on legendary difficulty. It may be a bit shorter, though this was played immediately after a midnight sale of this game. The co-op was well done, and creates a new feel for campaign FPS games. I look forward to the future where this will be the standard in playing games. The online is well done. Halo 3 has once again set the standard of what an online matchmaking/playing system should be. Putting together fun maps, objectives, and customizable Advatars, this game will appeal to the "newbie", as well as the everyday online Halo player. With the Halo 2 system being overhauled, and the Bungie stat-tracker updated, this game will quickly become the number one game on XBOX Live. I could write a five page review on this game, the battles, the enemies, weapons, and AI, but it still would not do it justice. If you have an XBOX 360, you should buy this, and buy it now. If you have thought about getting an XBOX 360, this would be the reason to get one. Does it live up to the hype? I don't think anything could have lived up to the hype that is game received. This game was praised as the second coming, but what it is one of the best games of 2007, and is beautiful and fun to play.</comment>

    <title>Perfect studying music</title>
    <comment>I'm sure a lot of you can remember back to the days when you would see tons of pure moods infomercial ads. There were right up there with the Time/Life music collections. We all dissmissed and ignored them, because, lets face it, they were annoying. I decided I would get a copy one day, and I have to say, I like every song on it. Many of them you've heard before. This album got me through college. This is the perfect studying music. I swear by it!</comment>

    <comment>No it's Halo on steroids. Best job yet, and you have to love when the final release continues to deliver new and exciting gameplay. If you have an Xbox360 and you aren't buying this, why did you buy the Xbox?</comment>

    <title>Best online gamer title</title>
    <comment>The single player game takes roughly 8 hours to complete on Normal setting which is too short for most hardcore gamer fans. Microsoft game studios obviously decided to push most of the development resources to the online gaming component of this version of the Halo line. The online maps are awesome. I will log many hours online with this game as I rise in the ranks of the UNSC. So, if your into online gaming, this title is for you!!!</comment>

    <title>Good game but too much HYPE!</title>
    <comment>Halo 3 definitely does not live up to the hype. All Bungie did was take Halo 2 change the levels and add a couple new weapons and vehicles. Graphically it does not come close to most Next Gen games. Single player mode can be beaten in 5-6 hours on normal. Legendary will take a bit longer. Don't get me wrong...Halo 3 is a fun game and worth the money if you plan on using multiplayer. I think Microsoft should of taken some of that $10 million spent on marketing and put it in their game.</comment>

    <title>Double check your shipping</title>
    <comment>Game looks incredible, but I have not played it yet ... still in transit. Just a reminder, double check your shipping. I ordered this for the free expedited shipping (saving myself a 10 minute drive). Unfortunately BestBuy.com recorded it as standard shipping (4x as long). I called them to correct it but they claim that once the order goes to the warehouse they can not change the shipping. I'm probably going to pick it up at a local store over the weekend and return this order to BB. Just a tip to check the delivery date on your order.</comment>

    <comment>Plays like all the other THPS games, but adds some new challanges to keep it fresh :) If you've never played a THPS game, pick it up, as it is a fun game. If you have played them, try the demo 1st, as you might not think its worth the money.</comment>

    <comment>The price is high, but once you go L class...there is no going back! the sharpness, colors, saturation is absolutely amazing. if you are considering this and the 24-105, i have shot with both and they are both very sharp, with the exception of the 24-105 corner softness and the f4 vs the f2.8. this lens is so worth the money. rent both lenses and make you decision. i got this over the 24-105 and i do not regret it.</comment>

    <title>Ouch!</title>
    <comment>This one hurts. I eagerly awaited this CD to see the direction HIM would take to follow up Dark Light. Turns out that direction was backward. At first glance, having only 9 songs concerned me, but then I thought "Hey, if they are 9 great songs" that would be ok. Some songs are good, classic HIM. Yet there is nothing new or fresh on here. In fact 'Sleepwalking Past Hope', shows that the band really did not put much effort into this disc. An almost 9 minute song filled with mostly "filler" noise said it all for me. If you have any of the older HIM cds, trust me, you have already heard Venus Doom.........</comment>

    <comment>It took all told about 2 hrs to put the stand together. The instructions were very good. Construction would have been much faster if you started with either a better allen wrench than is provided or a power drill (w/ correct allen head). It looks great though. Sturdy and very nice quality.</comment>

    <comment>I use this game for multi player most of the time. Because it is fun by yourself but it is even more fun with a friend. You can cover each other or take on the whole galaxy with just 2 people. I have played this game a ton and its still fun.</comment>

    <title>Interesting Enough</title>
    <comment>It's certainly not the best acted show on television today, but it is interesting. There are also several one-liners that don't always seem to fit with the rest of the script, but do provide a good amount of humor. Overall, if you have an interest in this type of show, I'd recommend Medium.</comment>

    <title>Great Show</title>
    <comment>It's sort of like ER meets Ally McBeal. One of my favorite shows of all time was Spin City. When I found out the same creator did Scrubs, I had to watch the show. While it is very different, the cleverness of the two is quite similar. Scrubs is a delight to watch and full of laughs and quotable moments. Definitely a season to own and watch over and over again.</comment>

    <title>It Never Stops</title>
    <comment>The laughs keep coming with this season of Scrubs. It is just as good as the first and just as hard to quit watching. Getting the DVDs is the only way to go so you can watch episode after episode commercial free.</comment>

    <title>POOR</title>
    <comment>This is a low budget movie. Thought it would be a good movie since Ashley Judd was in it but turned out to be horrible. The movie was mostly done in a hotel room and made no sense what so ever, started out boring and got worse. I would never rent or buy this movie, renting it was bad enough.</comment>

    <title>Good but not great...</title>
    <comment>To be perfectly honest and unbiased, I was highly anticipating this game even a year before the release. I'm mainly a shooter gamer-a couple of games on top of my list are Gears Of War and Rainbow Six Vegas which are purely a man's game. I don't think Halo 3 requires and "M" rating compared to the other two mentioned above. I would agree with other reviews that there's just too much hype and the crowd responded. Sometimes, people believe what they want to believe and not the facts. The graphics are not really what was promised, a little disappointed with that. I even noticed some morphing of characters with rocks etc. It's still a fun game but foes that scream like the 3 stooges prevent you from really taking this game to the next level. Halo 3 might be categorized as a teenager's game. Men 27 and above might find Gears Of War and Rainbow Six Vegas more realistic, appealing and satisfying. I would probably still recommend it but not to be taken seriously, maybe just to get closure on the story and to see what the fuss is all about.</comment>

    <comment>I love the gameplay of this one: super easy to learn compare to the first one, which is hard to operate your plane. Fan of Ace Combat should get this one! The button control response correctly to the position you want your plane to manuever. Very fun to play for novice to advanced.</comment>

    <comment>It has all the graphics, music, punches, kicks, combo- air juggles, blocks, counter, side steps, etc. There's no other fighting game like this one! Unique, strategic, challenging, and it takes dicipline to learn the chain of commands. Once you learn the commands the fun begins! Let the Iron Fist Tournament be with you!</comment>

    <comment>The best western ever made, period. This movie made alot of people start watching westerns more, especially those that didn't like them in the first place. Kurt Russell is the star, but Val Kilmer stole the movie with his role as Doc Holiday. This director's cut is better, because they put about four extra scene in the movie (not delete scenes). Dare I say, "Greatness"</comment>

    <title>MMM... Crack</title>
    <comment>This game is great the PS3 version even has updated graphics and is better than the Xbox 360 version. This game is great. As said hours of play in the hundreds literally, I persaonlly have logged at least 2 or 3 hundred hours and it is still tons of fun. The only downside is the frame rate drops out in insane battles and the games gets choppy but the GAME OF THE YEAR version come out 10.16 and hopefully that still wont be an issue this new version will include all the content for the game ever released including a new domain the shivering Isles.</comment>

    <comment>For weedheads this is the best movie ever, but for non-smokers this is stupid.

    <title>Great show for post college years</title>
    <comment>Imagine yourself 25 years down the road and looking back at post college years when you were just getting your career started like at the age of 27. Imagine looking for your future wife but not exactly knowing who she is but remembering every single moment that led up to that one perfect day. This is the basic backdrop of How I Met Your Mother. Of course there are many things that fall in between such as Neil Patrick Harris's infamous line "Suit Up!". The show is located in NYC mainly in an apartment and different places around NY but mainly set in their apartment and a bar called Mclanahan's which is conveniently ground level of their apartment. I love this show because aside from the jokes and laughter it relates to the post college late 20's person. Everyone knows right after college you find a job, maybe move out of the house, maybe move in with some friends, and maybe find the girl of your dreams. This show does a great job of portraying that lifestyle. Granted not everyone is so fortunate to be able to find a job and get an apartment in NYC but, for the most part I think this show portrays what most post college kids end up doing. The actors are excellent and you can almost relate yourself to a character because of the great acting. Ted is the hopeless romantic, Barney is the single bachelor who only thinks with one part of his body (later you find out why though), Marshal and Lily are your couple who are ready to take the plunge but still live young at heart, and Robin is the girl you can't have. All these characters are molded together to form a show that i think a basic post graduate late 20's person can relate to. One of my biggest concerns about this show is that it has similarities to the show Friends. I mean NYC apartment, they are all friends, and the things that go in between. But unlike friends, i think the jokes are a lot less "wow that was so corny or stupid that i have to laugh". The jokes are a bit more mature and very witty. They also dont do the occasional pause after a joke thing such as to say "cmon audience laugh now". They will say something and if it is actually funny the characters themselves will laugh and react to it as if they were really told a joke. The way things are revealed in the show are also excellent. A few twists and turns that are hard to see and thats what life is all about. Unexpected moments.</comment>

    <comment>This is the best console first person shooter (FPS) I have ever played. It has intuitive controls, great storyline and excellent graphics. The gameplay gives more than enough replayability with the online features as well as the co-op options. 4 player campaign co-op? heck yes, lol. Definite must-buy for the xbox!</comment>

    <title>Redman CONQUERS all in his way!!!</title>
    <comment>I've said many times that 1994 was a fanstastic year in hip hop, likely never to be that awesome again. Redman emerged again, two years after dropping his first classic album, Whut Thee Album. Dare Iz A Darkside, Redman's second, is so AWESOME that you just wondered how DARK this guy can get, and he displays that in this album. Some things MIGHT fly over your head, but there's no doubt that Redman kept you listening to everything he says, as you have no choice but to listen, and press rewind if you have to. Here's the review: Album Highlights: Well, it's a tough choice. All of these songs KNOCK, but songs like "Wuditlooklike" and the song with Hurricane G are hype lyrically, but suffer from a somewhat lackluster track. Production: Thumbs up. Erick Sermon shines here, as we get introduced to some production from Red himself and the upstart Rockwilder. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs way up. This guy's lyrics and unbelievable. Originality: Thumbs up. This was released in an era where you had to have talent on the mic to be looked @ considerably, unlike today. The Last Word: I want to give this album 5 stars, but from an overall standout. But you can't argue with this release, possibly the album in Redman's catalog that went unnoticed by most fans. But for the true hip hop heads such as myself, this album is AWESOME, and it represents Redman at the top of his superior game. Listen, and you'll be shocked and amazed. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Jay-Z goes out in style..... for now!</title>
    <comment>This was an unforgettable moment in hip hop: the retirement of the gifted Jay-Z. After blessing us fans with tight albums and cememting his position as one of the greatest of all time, he decides that he's said everything he could possibly say and that it's time to retire. With The Black Album, I was kind of expecting a 5 star classic. It is one? Well, you'll find out in this review. Album Highlights: Plenty to name here. December 4th, What More Can I Say, Encore, Moment of Clarity, Justify My Thug, Lucifer, and My 1st Song. Production: Thumbs up. Lyrics and Subject Matter. Thumbs up. As usual, Jigga is on point with the lyrics and subject matter. Originality: Thumbs up, but slightly. The Last Word: You'd think that with everything being thumbs up that this would make an easy candidate for 5 stars. Sadly, it isn't, but it's an EXCELLENT album, and it's a great way for Jigga to exit the game. Even after his retirement, hip hop seems MAD WEAK without him(even though we still have my favorite MC Nas, and others). I truly think it's his last and I wouldn't be surprised if he returns to bless us with a new album. Recommended.</comment>

    <title>Seriously?</title>
    <comment>Are you kidding me? Every stereotypical pot and "adult" joke was pulled out of retirement to make this movie. Judd Apatow was evidently more entertained with his script than with the delivery of the lines. Once all the funny parts from the trailer passed, I turned the movie off. It was still a waste of an hour... nothing unique about it.</comment>

    <title>Redman unloads on the debut album!</title>
    <comment>In 1992, hip hop was a different place, and if it were like that today, it would be so much better. After making his impressive debut with EPMD on their third album, Business As Usual, heads were wondering when was Redman going to drop an album. Well, that question was answered in supreme fashion. Redman can be seen one HARDCORE lyricist. This guy can battle you, inject humor(all with a tight flow) into a song, tell stories, and make you think ALL AT THE SAME TIME with ease and gusto. And his displays all that and then some on his first album. Here's the review: Album Highlights: EVERYTHING. You have to listen to all of the material from Redman in his early goings and wonder where did it all begin. Production: Thumbs way up. Erick Sermon offers some of his finest beats for Redman to rip through. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs way up. Who else can come gritty and hardcore like Red? Originality: Thumbs in the middle, nothing new here. The Last Word: This is one CLASSIC album that introduced the hip hop world to the MC known as Redman. He only got BETTER as the years went on, but in 92, he had heads bobbing to his debut, which set the precedent for his somewhat slept, but AWESOME second album "Dare Iz A Darkside." Overall, I recommend this album to you. You won't be disappointed.</comment>

    <title>Not Bad</title>
    <comment>First hour was slow and boring. Liam Neeson had a bit of difficulty disguising his accent at times, but overall both leads did very well. The story just needed more to it. The final 45 mins or so of the movie were interesting. The turning point has something to do with horse... you'll know when you see it. Overall, the same thing keeps happening over and over in different ways. There is, however, a good ending which almost saves the movie.</comment>

    <title>A BANGIN follow up to The Infamous</title>
    <comment>Mobb Deep can be best described as one of the greatest duos in hip hop history. They BLAZED hip hop in 1995 with the CLASSIC album, The Infamous, and they returned one year later with an album that's just as good as that album is. Havoc and Prodigy continued with their trends of hype, rebellious, East Coast gangsta music that would define their sound, and on this album, they did it with gusto, VERY SLIGHTLY even more so than on The Infamous. Here's the review: Album Highlights: Every song on this album is worth a listen, but the ONLY songs that could've been left off is "Can't Get Enough Of It" and "Get Dealt Wit." Production: Thumbs way up. Havoc's sound definitely reaches the apex(not its peak) on this release. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Check out Prodigy's show-stealing verses on "Nighttime Vultures", "G.O.D. Pt.III", and "The Apostle's Warning." Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: Let's set the record straight. 1)Is this album better than The Infamous? NO!!! It's a HARD follow up, but not better than the first album. 2)Is this album worthy of 5 stars? Sadly, no, but it's ALMOST there. This album is excellent, as it's Mobb Deep in their true form throughout. You don't get any better than that. Strongly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Loaded with "gifts" from Jay-Z</title>
    <comment>Jay-Z finally released his long awaited double CD in late 2002 with "Blueprint 2:The Gift and The Curse." Even though 2-Pac and Biggie released CLASSIC double albums years before, composing a FLAWLESS double album is IMPOSSIBLE, unless you have all of the necessary tools to keep filler out of your album(my favorite MC Nas WILL do it this year with the double CD "Street's Disciple"). Jigga tries his hand with this album, and it's pretty decent after the first few listens. Here's the review: Disc One Album Highlights: A Dream, 03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde, The Watcher 2, All Around The World, The Bounce, I Did It My Way, and Excuse Me Miss. Poppin Tags, F*** All Nite, and the song with Sean Paul are absolute filler. Production: Thumbs in the middle, but nowhere near horrible. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs SLIGHTLY up for this one. Originality: Thumbs in the middle. Nothing new here. Disc Two Album Highlights: Diamonds Are Forever, Guns N Roses, U Don't Know(Remix), Blueprint 2, Some People Hate, Meet The Parents, Some How, Some Way, and A Ballad For The Fallen Soldier. Feel free to skip 2 Many Hoes and N**** Please. Production: Thumbs in the middle, right on par with the first disc. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Originality: Thumbs up, but slightly. The Last Word: While not the flawless album that many thought it would, this is actually an excellent from Jay-Z. ONLY truly talented MCs like Jay-Z can release double albums that can make an impact. Although this release didn't set the world on fire, it truly represents Jigga as his retirement would soon be on the way. Recommended.</comment>

    <title>Jay-Z does it with the R.O.C</title>
    <comment>After coming off of the subpar release of "Vol.3 Life and Times of S.Carter", Jay-Z decided to place the emphasis not only on himself, but on Beanie Sigel, Memphis Bleek, and Amil. So, TECHNICALLY, this IS a Jay-Z album, although not solo in certain terms. But, let's cover the bases: 1) Jay-Z can PROVED he can hold an entire album by himself without the assistance of too many artists(even though he slipped badly with that on his third album). 2)Beanie Sigel can flow and get aggressive at times. 3)Memphis Bleek is MEDIOCRE at best. This guy is NO lyricist. 4)Amil is like Foxy Brown, all talk, no substance. And that's where we come to The Dynasty Roc La Familia album. It's an excellent album, as Jigga succeeded (and failed) at trying to elevate his fam to higher levels. The result was a fine album. Here's the review: Album Highlights: Change The Game, Streets Is Talking, Stick 2 Da Script, This Can't Be Life, Parking Lot Pimpin, 1-900 Hustler, Soon You'll Understand, and Where Have You Been. Everything else on this album is either mediocre at best or filler material. Production: Thumbs up. Jay-Z hooks up with The Neptunes for the first time here. Just Blaze, Bink, and others shine as well. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Check out Where Have You Been and Soon You'll Understand. Originality: Thumbs in the middle, no new ground broken here. The Last Word: Here's the deal. This was a successful album for Jigga, as "I Just Wanna Love You" became a hit and the album went double platinum. Beanie Sigel was already well-known when this album dropped. Memphis Bleek showed A LITTLE improvement here, but it was short-lived. Amil BOMBED on her first album, never really being considered something special. Overall, this is a great album from Jay-Z, and even though there's a little filler found here(there should NEVER be a Bleek SOLO on a JAY-Z album), it's still a decent effort from Jay-Z. Recommended.</comment>

    <title>Good material, but nothing to gloat about</title>
    <comment>Coming off of a somewhat weak album in the form of Vol.2...Hard Knock Life, Jay-Z had to get on the ball and drop something hot. With this album, he did it to a certain extent, but not all the way. He represents at times, but he still could have put forth a much more decent effort with this album, as it was RUMORED to be his last. I got some perspective on this album, and at the time I thought it was his best. Time certainly has been kind to me and my opinions. Here's the review: Album Highlights: So Ghetto, Do It Again, Dopeman, Watch Me, So Hot(Some Like It Hot), Big Pimpin, There's Been A Murder, and NYMP. The other songs, especially the song with WACK Juvenile, Pop 4 Roc, Girl's Best Friend, Things That U Do, and S.Carter should have been thrown in the recycle bin. Production: Thumbs SLIGHTLY up. D.J. Premier and Timbaland come through, Swizz tracks was NOT the best beat in the world, possibly his worst, and Irv Gotti and Lil Rob's track on "Watch Me" sounds like a Dr.Dre track. Nothing to write home about here. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs in the middle, although lyrically, he shines on So Ghetto, Do It Again, Dopeman, and So Hot. Originality: Thumbs in the middle, leaning towards down. Nothing groundbreaking or fresh from Jigga here. Just the standard formula of going with what works. The Last Word: Not a classic by any means, but it was a good step for Jay-Z after dropping the unbalanced Hard Knock Life. It could've been better, but you take what you can get. Overall, a good album, but I wouldn't recommend you going out of your way to get this release.</comment>

    <title>Pretty good, but nothing more</title>
    <comment>So much has been said about this album, that Jay-Z was "completely in a zone, focused and creative" during the making of this album. After getting a few years of perspective on this album, how can ANYONE say that this album is EXCELLENT or BORDERLINE CLASSIC? How? This album might have sold many units, but top notch records sales DO NOT equal a classic album. Vol.2 Hard Knock Life was hailed by critics and fans alike as some of Jay-Z's best material. I "respectfully" disagree. Here's the COMPLETE review: Album Highlights: Hard Knock Life, A Week Ago, Money,Cash,Hoes(w/DMX), and N**** What N**** Who. Every other song on this album is ABSOLUTE filler and it's not worth your time in listening to it. Production: Thumbs in the middle, leaning towards down. Not the best production in the world. Timbaland and Swizz made the best tracks, Everything else is either poorly composed or mediocre at best(check Kid Capri's track). Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs in the middle, leaning towards down. Jigga represents on the tracks mentioned in the album highlights section. On everything else, lyrically, is not material to gloat about. Originality: Thumbs WAY down. If Jay-Z would have done this album in a way like The Blueprint, it would have been better, but since NEARLY every song features another artist, this album loses SERIOUS points with me. The Last Word: Not too much to say here that I haven't said already. Is this album worth buying for the four best songs? Certainly not. Jay-Z didn't slip up with In My Lifetime Vol.1. He slipped up here, and it shows. Overall, I can't seriously recommend this album. But if you consider this a must have of any type, be prepared to be disappointed. Otherwise, don't even bother.</comment>

    <title>Scarface FIXED up a CLASSIC</title>
    <comment>2002 was starting to become a "dead zone" as far as hip hop is concerned. But the almighty Scarface, coming off of the "near classic" The Last of a Dying Breed album, returned to bless us with The Fix, an album that I like to describe as being "conceptually beautiful." Not only is this album one of his best, it was possibly the best album of 2002, although CHALLENGED by Nas' God Son album. Just like his other 5 star classic The Diary, this album is another album where Face is truly in his prime, still 10 years in the game and he hasn't peaked yet. Here's the review: Album Highlights: Once again, Scarface delivers an album with absolutely NO filler. Even though I don't like WC, the song featuring him is TIGHT. Production: Thumbs up. He hooked up with Kanye West and The Neptunes for this one. You'd think that with their different styles that they wouldn't suit the nature of Scarface. But they do, and they do with STYLE. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs way way up. Listen to the songs with Faith Evans and Kelly Price, and you'll see what I mean. Originality: Thumbs way up. NO ONE was coming like this in 2002. The Last Word: One CLASSIC album from Scarface. He came back and did it again with this release, and he managed to release this at a time when hip hop was starting to get weak. If other artists can release albums as excellent as this, hip hop would be better. But as for now, this album stands as a true testament to Scarface's prowess as an artist. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.</comment>

    <title>Only the beginning of the LEGEND known as LL</title>
    <comment>LL Cool J is one of the all-time greats in hip hop, bar none. If you've been a fan of hip hop for a while like me, then you know the kind of precedent he set. This debut made LL a bonafide star, and it's indeed a classic, one of his best recordings. Here's the review: Album Highlights: Even though EVERY song stands out on this album, the true highlights of this album are I Can't Live Without My Radio, Dear Yvette, and Rock The Bells. Production: Thumbs up. Lyrics and Subject Middle: Thumbs in the middle, leaning slightly towards up. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: The first classic gem from the man know as LL. He showed true talent and charisma on this album, and remained a dominant force in the industry over the next several years. Overall, I recommend this album.</comment>

    <title>The BLUEPRINT for STORYTELLING</title>
    <comment>NO ONE who listens to any form of hip hop can deny Slick Rick's strength when it comes to storytelling. It wouldn't be a form of any type if The Ruler didn't set the stage for it all. With the release of his debut album in 88, he did it with SUPREME finesse, like no other BEFORE him and certainly AFTER him(maybe with Nas, Jay-Z, Kool G.Rap, and others). This album truly defines what storytelling in hip hop is supposed to be like. Here's the review: Album Highlights: EVERY song on this album is BRILLIANT, nuff said. Production: Thumbs up, most people to this day don't have any clue that some of the beats on this album was handled by Public Enemy's own Bomb Squad. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs way, way up. Like I said, Slick Rick set the blueprint for storytelling in hip hop. Originality: Thumbs up, no one, other that Kool G. Rap, was coming with such profound storytelling in hip hop in 88. The Last Word: ANOTHER landmark moment in hip hop. It was pregnant with landmark moments in 88. This is album is EXCELLENT in every sense of word, and you owe it to yourself to own this album. A STRONG RECOMMENDATION from me. If you like hip hop in ALL of its true glory and form, this album is for you.</comment>

    <title>The beginning of the BCC!!</title>
    <comment>Black Moon may have had an underground sound, but they truly emerged at a time when the hip hop world was literally being dominated by the West Coast sound. In 1993, they released Enta Da Stage, an album that STILL knocks til this very day. They might not have made sn impact in record sales, but this album represents the Black Moon click at their very BEST, completely in their primes. Here's the review: Album Highlights: Although there's NO filler, and every song on this album is a banger, check out these gems: N*** Talk ***t, Who Got Da Props, Son Get Wrec, Black Smif N Wessun, Buck Em Down, Make Munne, S**t Iz Real, I Got Cha Opin, Enta Da Stage, How Many MCs, and U Da Man. Production: Thumbs up, the very first classic material from the Beatminerz. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: Some may say that Black Moon were ahead of their time. I don't know about that, but in 93, that had the underground sound that most still embrace today. This debut is one CLASSIC, featuring some of Buckshot's greatest material. It couldn't have dropped at a better time. Overall, I STRONGLY recommend this album.</comment>

    <title>Smif N Wessun SHINES with this album</title>
    <comment>What a year 1994 was. The release of CLASSIC material that year was relevant, and this album by Smif N Wessun is relevant too, for all the right reasons. Just like Black Moon before them, this album represents not only Smif N Wessun, but the entire Boot Camp Clik in their primes. Tek and Steele come off smoothly on every track, and the production by The Beatminerz in something amazing. Here's the review: Album Highlights: Every song here KNOCKS!! Absolutely NO filler on this one. Production: Thumbs up, some of The Beatminerz' best work. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: This is one AWESOME album, from start to finish. It didn't set me on fire when I first heard it, but after a couple of listens, it grew on me just like Black Moon's first album did. This album, out of many, represents the resurgence of the East Coast sound in hip hop, after hip hop was dominated by the West Coast for a period. Overall, I strongly recommend this album to anyone who wants to purchase this.</comment>

    <comment>This game is amazing. I use to be a playstation person so I didnt really get into the Halo games. I played a little of the first two and then just got the third. It is worth all of the hype. After Im done with this one I will go out and play the other two. The co op play is great and driving around with the vehicles was the coolest thing ever. I love the tank I found around level 6. Check this title out. Everybuddy on my friends list is playing this game.</comment>

    <title>PHENOMENAL!!!!</title>
    <comment>Run-DMC did it again with the release of their third album. If their first two albums didn't put them on the map, then this one CERTAINLY did. It set all kinds of historical precedence for hip hop(and music in general), the likes of which will NEVER be matched again. Run, DMC, and Jam Master Jay returned with gusto with this album, proving to everyone that their success was no fluke, and it WASN'T. Here's the review: Album Highlights; Peter Piper, Walk This Way, Dumb Girl, It's Tricky, and My Adidas. Production: Thumbs up. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: Another landmark in hip hop. Run-DMC forever made their mark in the world of music with this AWESOME album. If you don't own this album now, you're truly missing out on something classic and special. Strongly recommended.</comment>

    <comment>Let me start by saying that if you are a Halo fan, you will no doubt want to buy this game as it is on par with the other two, though slightly shorter campaign wise. The online multiplayer aspect is all Halo 2 was and more while also allowing for campaign coop. You can also design your own multiplayer maps and record match play which is a nice touch. Now to the only real con but was enough to knock my rating to 4 stars.. the graphics make the game look to be a very well polished Halo 2. This is definitely not up to par with Gears and maybe not even R6V, depending upon your taste. Overall, a definite buy if you own a 360. But, if you have never been able to get into the fps genre, you probably won't care to now.</comment>

    <title>Olde School Sweetness</title>
    <comment>From the preview video I downloaded off of x-box live to all the articles I've read on this game it looks fantastic. I like how they are handling the overall gameplay and being able to climb on almost anything and just cause a ruckus in the middle of a crowded bazaar just seems fun. In the middle of all these technological games based in the future it's nice to see a game that looks really good based more in and olde english setting. I would much rather have a sword and sneaky assasin tools to sneak up on someone than just shooting until they die. It takes more patience and skill that way and I hope that it presents a challenging gameplay oportunity for me.</comment>

    <comment>It's super smash bros. need i say more. no, well i'm going to rant anyway :-) i can't wait for this installment of the series. I loved the original one on the N64 and Melee was fantastic as well. The new characters will be fun to get used to controlling and the classic ones will hopefully keep the same feel and control. This game is going to spawn many a self held tournaments.</comment>

    <title>planet terror will rock you!</title>
    <comment>planet terror will rip through your tv screen on 10-16-07 with ott action with a vengence for blood and gore. most people will tell you that if they had to pick one of the grindhouse films, it would be this one over death proof. this film has more violence and gore than death proof. it's also got more laughs and cheezy one-liners. it also has more of that grindhouse feel. the movie will look kind of tattered and old, like it was run through the grinder, spit on and kicked around, or the reel operator is having trouble. death proof only carried this feel through the first half of the film, the second half looks more finished. the only thing i'm disapointed about is that the dvd is only 86 minutes! that means that they will be giving you the theatrical version plus 3 or 4 minutes of uncut material. i wanted a longer version like death proof's 114 minute version.</comment>

    <title>I love these headphones</title>
    <comment>I can't believe that I spent $15 to $25 on at least 10 pairs of headphones, when I could have just bought these. Far superior to any headphone I've ever listened to, especially in the $25 range. I think I went as high as $40 for one pair. Your MP3 player is only as good as your headphones. If you listen to a $400 IPOD on $20 headphones, you wasted $400</comment>

    <title>Extremely intense horror</title>
    <comment>High Tension could not have been a more perfect title. When I watch a horror movie I want to be forced to the edge of my seat, to have my heart jumping out of my throat, and boy did this one deliver. It's intense in tone and violence but not necessarily in making you jump. Don't operate heavy machinery directly after finishing. Oh and the twist at the end wasn't terrible, but it wasn't necessary either. The first 80 minutes or whatever make the movie.</comment>

    <comment>great cable! really improves the sound of anything digital. ive used a few different optical cables and the problem i typically run into is that the head does not usually fit snugly into the souce, the dynex has the best fit of the cables i have used.</comment>

    <title>great dvd</title>
    <comment>This dvd has most of the deicide classics plus some new stuff. Great sound. Camera guys get a lot of angles so it wont get boring. My only complaint is the absence of the hoffman bros. As much as i like dave suzuki and jack owen, it doesnt quite feel like deicide without the hoffmans. heres to hoping the original deicide members stop acting like babies and get back together.</comment>

    <title>Ugh</title>
    <comment>I have never owned madden on PC but I had to get it. I was sorely disappointed to find that EA doesn't care about PC gamers, they didn't put much effort into this one. From the sound of it they never have. I still play it because I can't own an XBox or PS3, but it leave a lot to be desired.</comment>

    <title>Only option for cleaning</title>
    <comment>Only thing to use on your HDTV, the microfiber cloth won't scratch lcd, plasma and dlp screens like a paper towel or random things that you may be used to cleaning with around your house. The one thing I have heard is that on Pioneer Plasma's it leaves a milky film, however, I have never witnessed this.</comment>

    <title>Outstanding</title>
    <comment>I'm a music fanatic, so when I recently bought my Mac notebook, the built-in speakers just didn't cut it. So after reading the reviews and listening to these in the store I decided to buy them. I havent been able to turn my music off for 4 months since I bought them. For their price, size, and lack of woofer these speakers put out some mind-blowing sound. Living up to the Bose name, every single strum of a guitar and note from a piano can be heard crisply and clearly. If you want Hi-Def music at an affordable price nothing will beat these. My only complaint is that they don't get loud enough for my tastes. These can easily fill a medium sized room but due to the lack of woofer, when the volume is turned way up, the electronic equalizer makes the sound come in waves so the low end tones can be heard equally and makes for an odd sound and they need to be turned down. If you want speakers that are good for private listening and not mean to entertain a crowd, then I guarantee these are the best choice. There are no crisper speakers out there for 100 bucks.</comment>

    <title>Just Press Play</title>
    <comment>If your tired of buying cd's that force you to use the skip button every other song, you're in luck. This is the best R&amp;B album of the year and when you put it in....just press play. Its an album with a story line so do not put your CD player on random. Put it in and just press play. It's that good.</comment>

    <title>WHAT A DEAL!!!</title>
    <comment>For this little bit of dough, you can get a concert with this much caliber? To see THE GODFATHERS OF METAL!!!Give up any preconceptions (Did I just use a college word?) about Sabbath cause these guys are firing on all cylinders! Why am I screaming?!! Well, I don't believe you'll find a smoother jam. It's a feeling , an emotion that you're gonna get when you see the band that burned the path for all to follow. You will not dream of a better concert. But, if you do, you better wake up and appologize! Get this newbies and learn what true class and integrity is all about!</comment>

    <comment>This album is everything I expected and more. While the good old acoustic sound brings us back to the earlier albums, the vocals, production, etc. has clearly matured into [in my opinion], some of Dashboard's best material yet. YES! I LOVE IT!

    <comment>Well, Halo 3 certainly lived up to its expectations in my opinion!!! Great game!!! Graphics are amazing!!! Only negative is that campaign is short and easy, but if you are mainly a Halo "Live" player like myself, then this shouldn't matter to you at all.</comment>

    <title>KRS DELIVERS the second time around!!</title>
    <comment>Krs-One is another one of those MCs, on a SHORT list of them, whose second album COMPLETELY took the first. By All Means Necessary was EXCELLENT, as he, just like Public Enemy did in 88, brought a conscious and more political state of awareness to hip hop. This album represents Krs in his true form, and it shows on EVERY song. Here's the review: Album Highlights: EVERY song is worth a listen. Production: Thumbs up. Lyrics and Subject Mattere: Thumbs up. Other than Public Enemy, who else was coming this political in 88? Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: This was a great moment for hip hop music. Krs-One came back in 88 for this second album and he didn't disappoint. If hip hop was still like this today, it would be so much better. One can only hope. Overall, I strongly recommend this album to any fan of hip hop, if you're into politically charged hip hop.</comment>

    <title>They SCORED with this album!</title>
    <comment>In 1996, hip hop was a different place, although a few years from becoming the wack music it is now. Pac and Biggie were still alive, Jay-Z was getting started, Nas reigned supreme, and you had the Fugees, a group who were SO momumental together that their presence was always something to behold. This album, their second, is BRILLIANT. They released hit songs in 96 from this album, and they did what most other artists CAN'T do: they TOPPED their first album, and they did it with supreme excellence. Here's the review: Album Highlights: Too many to mention here, but there is NO filler. Production: Thumbs up, Wyclef earned his bones with the beats, and so did Pras, Lauryn, and Diamond D. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs Up. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: In today's hip hop, we could certainly use a group like The Fugees. But, I'm afraid it won't happen again, but you never know!!! But with this album, The Fugees collectively were on top of their game, as they really brought out the best in each other. Classic album??? Definitely. Another strong recommendation for this album. You will enjoy this.</comment>

    <title>Snoop in his prime!!!!!</title>
    <comment>Snoop Dogg reigned supreme in 93 with this CLASSIC. Snoop was perhaps one of the coolest rappers to emerge from the west during this time, and when he dropped this album, he took the east AND the west by storm. And what resulted was his ABSOLUTE BEST album to this very day. Here's the review: Album Highlights: The ENTIRE album, EVERY song here literally is a classic. Production: Thumbs up, laced with the supreme skills of Dr.Dre. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up, Snoop doesn't rhyme like this today. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: It's a shame that we don't have THIS Snoop today. But in 93, he was on top of the world, on top of his game, and TRULY in his prime. He didn't peak until he went to the corny No Limit Records in an attempt to resurrect his career. But with Doggystyle, he forged an unforgettable classic, up there with the likes of Dre's The Chronic. Another STRONG recommendation for this album. You won't regret buying this album.</comment>

    <title>POWERFUL</title>
    <comment>Did Dr.Dre set hip hop on fire with this album or what?!!! In 1993, hip hop heads weren't prepared for this one, as Death Row came through and literally dominated the hip hop scene. The Chronic is a gritty MASTERPIECE, one of the greatest albums to EVER be released. This album also has the reputation of being POSSIBLY the best produced album that Dre has been responsible for. It put Snoop Dogg on the map, and the world hasn't been the same since. Here's the review: Album Highlights: The ENTIRE album, no filler on this one. Production: Thumbs WAY up, Dre at his supreme best. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: This album is SO AWESOME,from start to finish. Everything you could possibly want out of a gangsta album, THIS IS IT. There will NEVER AGAIN be an album this powerful in hip hop, especially in today's hip hop. Dr.Dre himself would have to word TRIPLE overtime to produce another CLASSIC like this. Overall, one of the STRONGEST recommendations EVER.</comment>

    <title>Another bright spot for the West Coast!!</title>
    <comment>The D.O.C. was a great talent in his prime, until an unfortunate car accident forver altered his once commanding voice. After the release of the phenomenal Straight Outta Compton album from N.W.A., The D.O.C. hooked up with Dre again to produce this classic. DOC was at his true form on this album, choosing to focus on rocking rough rhymes instead the gangsta attitude that N.W.A. displayed. And what resulted was one fine hip hop album. Here's the review: Album Highlights: It's Funky Enough, Whirlwind Pyramind, The Formula, The Grand Finale(w/N.W.A.), The D.O.C. and The Doctor, and Lend Me An Ear. Production: Thumbs up, more classic production by Dr.Dre. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Originality: Thumbs Up. The Last Word: The D.O.C. reigned supreme with this release. Although challenged by Ice Cube, The D.O.C., around the time in 89 when this was released, was a force to reckoned with, ALMOST ahead of his time in a way. Overall, the album is tremendous in every sense of the word, as it truly defines the West coast sound in all of its glory. Strongly recommended.</comment>

    <title>An Award Tour with the Tribe!!!</title>
    <comment>How many artists can say they released THREE STRAIGHT CLASSIC album? Not too many. But A Tribe Called Quest(and Public Enemy just to name one more)certainly did. I've said many times that 1993 was a tremendous year for hip hop, and this album is one of the reasons why. Midnight Marauders is CLASSIC, up there with their first two albums. They only got BETTER as the years went on, and they delivered their third straight classic. Here's the review: Album Highlights: NO filler here, but the highlights are Steve Biko(Stir it up), Award Tour, Clap Your Hands, Electric Relaxation, and Oh My God. Production: Thumbs up. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: What a GREAT album this is. With no filler(just like the first two albums), nice beats and lyrics throughout, this is a certified classic. Another STRONG recommendation for you to purchase this album if you have not done so. This IS the Tribe at their best. It's a shame that they disbanded in 98.</comment>

    <title>Check the Tribe!!!!!</title>
    <comment>1991 was a GREAT year in hip hop. I was glad to see Organized Konfusion, Public Enemy, Ice Cube, Main Source, and others drop GEMS. Also, A Tribe Called Quest with their second album. This album is one of the greatest EVER, and it's production(and lyrics as well) is what pushed it over the top. If you didn't feel the impact on their first album, you DEFINITELY felt it on this album. Here's the review: Album Highlights: NO filler, but the HIGHLIGHTS are Check the rhyme, Buggin out, Butter, Show Business(w/Brand Nubian &amp; Diamond D), Jazz, and Scenario(w/Leaders Of The New School). Production: Thumbs up, Ali Shaheed's BEST production ever. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: The GREATEST album from the ATCQ catalog. Most artists' second album usually cannot touch their first, but the Tribe did it, and they did it in style and grace. A STRONG RECOMMENDATION for this album if you don't own it. Don't be left out on owning one AWESOME album.</comment>

    <title>The first in a series of three straight classics</title>
    <comment>A Tribe Called Quest is one of the greatest groups ever in hip hop, and if you own any of their albums, you know why. This debut album is so great to listen to. At first, I wasn't impressed by it. But after the second listen, I realized that it IS a classic. It was released in 1990 along with other gems that year, and ATCQ certainly made their mark. Here's the review: Album Highlights: Although there's no filler, the highlights are Luck of Luciei, Can I Kick It, I Left my wallet in El Segundo,and Bonita Applebum. Production: Thumbs up. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up. Originality: Thumbs up. The Last Word: This is a great album, and you should own this it you currently don't have it. ATCQ only got BETTER as the years went by, and this album was a tremendous start in that direction. Strongly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Very fun game!</title>
    <comment>Another fun product from Ubisoft, The Settlers: Rise of an Empire seems to be money well spent so far. It is very much like the previous Settlers games with some upgrades. I just got the game last night and I got through about 6 of the campaign scenarios and I like what I see so far. Building your town is quite fun and you can choose from several different hero's that you find along the way to take with you from mission to mission. Each hero has different benefits that they bring with them so choose what you think you will need for the particular mission you are on. On the down side, so far I haven't been overly impressed with the combat system. The army size is not that large and I have only been able to build swordsmen and archers so far. There isn't much strategy as far as the actual combat goes, at least not so far in the game. You just build some troops and send them in, whoever has more will win &lt;shrug&gt;. It is still early in the game though so I'm hoping some more units will become available later on. You can however, zoom in very closely and watch the fight up close and personal. This title seems to be more about managing your town and a little less emphasis on the combat system but for me at least, it doesn't take that much away from the game. The campaign missions are well done and take you along a story line that seems to be fairly interesting so far introducing you to your arch rival. One thing that really drew me to this game was the fact that they advertise cooperative multi player. My friends and I are always looking for something we can play together not against each other so this was a very nice feature to have.</comment>

    <comment>I grew up listening to Heart and I can tell you that this DVD is one of the best live recordings of the band. If you love good rock music, you need to check this out. The ladies rock hard in front of their home town audience. They are energetic and look and sound amazing. This DVD is best played on a large tv with a great sound system. You can't go wrong with this DVD, Ann and Nancy rock!</comment>

    <comment>Okay, I admit it, Halo 3 doesn't set any new trends in the field of FPS games nor does it dramatically change or revolutionize the gameplay from its previous sequels. What Halo 3 does do however is put everything in the game to make the fun last as long as possible. And that's pretty much what any gamer could ask for in a game.</comment>

    <title>THE NEXT BEST THING</title>
    <comment>I will never forget when I first heard her debut single, "Goodies," I always turned the radio down or to another station for that matter. When I first saw the video I had to step back and say, "Who is this?!" I mean she was not only hot, but she could dance better than the females who were already out. After that is when I started turning the radio up instead of down. I bought The Evolution the day it came out, right when I got out of schoo. I have NEVER done that for an artist, but I have to say over the few years she has been around I have really become a fan. I went to Best Buy on 38th Street and it was right up front with Gwen Stefani and Eminem and I copped it! I put it in and once I heard, "I BET U DONT GET CRUNK!" I knew it was gonna be hot. I love this CD from beginning to the very end. Ciara is on her way and I knew that once I found out she out sold Gwen Stefani by selling over 388,000 copies her first week putting her atop of the charts at #1. So go get it because you wont be disappointed. ITS CIARA TIME!!!</comment>

    <comment>Good guy against a lot of bad guys. Great action. Well directed. Willis keeps it light and funny. Rickman is the classic bad guy. You need to own this one. The classic action movie.</comment>

    <title>awesome</title>
    <comment>this movie was the best superman movie yet, yes it was way better than superman returns. but yeah, the only real thing i have to complain about was doomsday was only in the movie for the first half hour of the movie (personally, i wouldnt mind watching a 2 hour fight scene between doom and sup). the other negative was...supermans face looked kinda weird, and lois' voice didnt really fit her looks. but all in all, this is a great movie, every super hero fan should see this.</comment>

    <title>Incredible.</title>
    <comment>This game is the only reason I bought a 360 over a PS3. And thankfully it lived up to my expectations. The graphics are pretty good. Not as good as a few other 360 games, but still good enough. The game play is great. Computer AI on the Heroic and Legendary difficulties has been improved quite a bit. I do recommend that if you're a seasoned Halo and Halo 2 player, you start the campaign right away on at least Heroic. Normal mode is just simply way to easy. Perhaps on of the best things about the game is the sound. I have it hooked up to a home theater system and an LCD TV, and it is just an incredible, enveloping experience. And of course with the solid online multi-player, I know already that I'll get just as many years of enjoyment out of this one as I did Halo and Halo 2. Don't even hesitate. Just buy it now. (oh, but don't waste your money on the Limited Edition. I did, and I have to say that was ten extra dollars, poorly spent)</comment>

    <title>Great for fans of the show.</title>
    <comment>Some episodes, especially those dealing with Ari and "Medellin" are terrific. There are a few "stand alone" episodes that have nothing to do with the overall story arc and feel more like a sitcom rather than the comedy-drama we've all come to love. I will still continue to support the show but feel a little cheated with Season 3B, I just feel it was rushed and could have been better.</comment>

    <title>" Starless "</title>
    <comment>I got excited with this radio price and the above reviews. To the point of buying the 2 years extra replacement warranty offered by Best Buy @ $ 6.99. Originally, I bought this radio for my Bus commuting. I was NOT able to hear anything. To my dismay, problems continued when walking outdoors. Nothing wrong with the volume, which was adequate. It is basically a poor intermitent reception, sometimes with static. I had previously already unwinded and straightened out (without stretching ) the headphones wire which happens to be the antenna. Talking of headphones, they would slide upon walking. Never mind jogging. Reminds me of another cheap radio I wasted my money with elsewhere. RETURNING to outlet branch FIRST thing in the morning. Thank goodness for Best Buy great returns policy. Still, I might be given the same brand another chance with the MP3.</comment>

    <comment>With an all new line up on the strings, David Coverdale belts out classic Whitesnake show stoppers with out mercy. This dvd will not do justice to this show if it's not heard on Surround Sound. Tommy Aldrige still handles the drums. His solo is unreal! Doug Aldrich jams guitars along with Reb Beach! Marco Mendoza handles bass with Timothy Drury on keyboard. This dvd rocks!</comment>

    <title>OK, but not spectacular</title>
    <comment>I bought this product because I am a Superman fan. I also bought the last Superman TV series which used to show on the WB network. Before buying this product I read the reviews of others and would have to agree with those who said that the voice casting should have been the same people who were cast in the WB animated series. This inconsistent casting was the thing that most detracted from my enjoyment of the story. I wasn't too impressed with way Superman was drawn in this DVD, but that was a minor annoyance. I also agree with those who said that the Doomsday villain was not fleshed out enough. I think if the producers had stuck with the story that was in the graphic novel, the DVD would have been better. Since the producers went all out to include a special feature on the original "Death of Superman" story that appeared in the comics, it seems logical to translate all of that onto the DVD story. In fairness, though, this version did have some interesting plot twists that allowed it hold my attention. I just wasn't left with a "gee whiz" feeling when the end credits ran. DC, if you're listening, ... you missed a golden opportunity! You could have done the graphic novel story as a mini-series of DVDS released over a period of months. I would have gladly bought 'em all! Also DC .... (if you're listening) Don't You think it's way past due for a series on the Green Lantern Corps?</comment>

    <title>raw energy</title>
    <comment>If the Dead Kennedys wrote the soundtrack to Borat, this is what it would sound like. Gogol Bordello is a full band from New York, complete with accordian. Their energy on songs like Tribal Revolution and Alcohol cannot be matched. They even manage to mix elements of dub and reggae into their elaborate amalgamation of influences. Their songs do not follow the typical three chord punk blueprint. These are fully fledged ideas, not song outlines. An incredibly focused effort from a supremely unique, talented band.</comment>

    <comment>Bowie's Low kicked off his massively influential Berlin Trilogy, in collaboration with Brian Eno. In a role that cannot be over emphasized, producer Tony Visconti steps in to add some of the most important and memorable ideas to Low. The razor sharp first side introduces jagged, distorted guitars mixed with high end snare beats. The second side is highlighted by atmospheric masterpieces Warszawa and Subterraneans. Low is a beyond adequate way to the second half of Bowie's incredible decade. An album that Bowie will likely never top.</comment>

    <comment>My entire family watched this movie together thinking we were going to be entertained by a good movie with a cast of talented people. It was not a movie to watch with the family and we will be lucky to get rid of it at our next garage sale for next to nothing. My jaw hung open the entire movie. A total waste of money.</comment>

    <title>Can't wait until Season 2 comes out on DVD</title>
    <comment>Kyle XY is the best show I think that ABC has ever done. Each week is entertaining and full of surprises. The Season 1 DVD is fantastic. I did miss one episode, and because of that, it was hard to follow along with the rest of the season....not totally knowing what was happening and why. Now that I have watched the full season from beginning to end, it makes the whole season even more special and meaningful. This is truly a collection that I will watch over and over again! Hopefully Season 2 will come out on DVD soon. I did watch every episode, but it will be great to see them all again.</comment>

    <title>Works well in Oakland, CA</title>
    <comment>I bought a Toshiba LCD HDTV recently but was just watching DVD's, playing XBox 360 and streaming videos from my laptop... No cable, no satellite, no live TV. I decided I'd give an antenna a try. This RCA model was the first one I bought, mostly because of the advertised signal amplification. This Sunday I'm watching crystal clear HDTV football on Fox and CBS, perfect picture 1080i and 720p. I may just be in a good location, a 3rd floor apartment across from Sutro tower. The VHF analog (don't care about that any more) reception here stinks though, but the digital channels all come in great. Get Fox, NBC, ABC, CBS, The CW, PBS (4 channels). I get a total of 30 digital channels that I want to watch, plus a couple I don't care about. I really didn't think just buying a $40 antenna would get me that much, I'm pleasantly surprised.</comment>

    <comment>This cabe works pretty good. The screw on connection did not get stuck like some other cables I've used went on very easily. I'm disapointed Best Buy stopped carrying the Acoustic Research brand they cost less than this one but worked just as good electrically although they had a tendency to bind during installation if not perfectly lined up.</comment>

    <title>Outstanding headphones</title>
    <comment>although the price is through the roof (my parents gave me bloody ears because they were hysterical i spent tht much) these headphones are incomparable with other headphones with comfort and sound quality, my ears dont get hot with long listening sessions and i dont have to turn up my mp3 players volume to much so its battery lasts longer. the bass is amazing and crisp with little or no distotion at full volume, and the triport design gives it crisp clear non-crackly highs associted with other headphones :) i think they look good to, but a color choice would be nice. verdict: buy them, they will last forever and they will perform just like the day you bought them.</comment>

    <comment>I origionally watched the first episode on T.V. From then- I was hooked. I never missed an episode, and of course HAD to buy the DVD- only so I can watch it over and over again. We're already in the 4th season, and I still get a kick out of watching the first season's episodes. This is a must buy!</comment>

    <title>Good but not Great</title>
    <comment>This film was good. I would not rank it Great. It gave you the back drop on how Hanabal became who we all know him as. The only thing is that certain parts were a little to far out there and made you feel like you could not picture Hanabal doing that or things that way (this could be due to Anthony Hopkins performance being almost perfect to play the roll). Some of the things that happen made you feel like this was a movie more to show him killing people and not how he learned everything he did and how he became as educated as he was. Overall I did enjoy it for the most part and I like the whole Hanabal series.</comment>

    <title>Great</title>
    <comment>I was a little afraid to see this film due to the poor advertising. The film came off as if it were a spin off of Hanabla Lecter's character in a murder mystery film also staring Anthony Hopkins. The good news is, its not. It was a well done movie and it had nothing to do with Hanabal. I enjoyed this film and would watch it again.</comment>

    <title>Great Film</title>
    <comment>This is one of those great feel good movies. The kind where a man shoots another in the face and you feel good about it because the shooter is a person just like you who is not going to take it anymore and the victim an evil person who deserves it. I liked this movie. The first time I rented this movie and saw it I went out the next day and bought it. Its one of those films you want to see again.</comment>

    <comment>This movie was great. Its one of those films where everyone is in the right place at the right time. All the acting is great. It has a lot of those "I know that guy" actors in it. If you have not seen it I recommend it. It's got a few twists and turns to it and the ending is great.</comment>

    <title>A Good Show</title>
    <comment>alot of people have had mixed reviews about this season of 24 that it had the same story plot about terrorists trying to get a nuclear weapon and cause destruction on US Soil but if your a die hard fan of the series you'll put that all behind you and enjoy another new season of 24 atleast next season its going to go to another level of story telling, no nuclear weapons, or virus or assassinations plots but i heard it centers on the presidents son being murdered and thinks its a cover up to it. sounds interesting.</comment>

    <title>Zombies and the Military</title>
    <comment>For past couple of years, Hollywood is just loving Zombie movies and with this sequel hopefully it will be the end. I liked this movie but it kinda reminded me of Aiens with introduction of an army to help the fight of zombies. If you liked the first than you'll like this one, but don't expect to see returning characters</comment>

    <title>Greatness</title>
    <comment>How do end a money franchrise at its peek, kill off all or most of the main characters. I love this movie because it kinda stayed with the base of Marvel's concept but Hollywood adds a little of their magic. If I were to have a problem with this movie it would be that once again they stayed on the Logan too much and not on younger mutants. This is probably the last of the X-men movies, but if they decide to squeeze one more, can we have a storyline with the younger mutants (Iceman, Shadowcat, Rogue) either fighting the Morlocks or the Brotherhood...just a suggestion</comment>

    <title>A Favorite of Mine for Many, Many Years</title>
    <comment>"The Hollywood Knights" is far from cinematic excellence, but it is much better than what the critics say. Yes, it is juvenile, crude, and low-budget. The plot is not the best or the most original, and the writer decided to include some sub-plots that prove to be nothing but distractions. (I've always claimed that nothing kills a comedy better than a plot.) One other criticism - the time frame of all the events in the plot -- there is no way all this could happen in the one night in which this movie takes place. (Oh well, if you can suspend reality for the likes of Star Wars and such, you can suspend reality for this one . . . ) One the other hand, there are some great laughs in this movie - enough to keep you entertained through its running time of 99 minutes. Like "Animal House", "Airplane", and "Caddyshack", it is definitely one of those "guy flicks". And it is just as quotable - as guys like to do. This movie has been a staple among the guys in my extended family for over 20 years now, and not too many family events go by without hearing a quote or two from this movie. And if you want to talk about star power, this movie has it - well, sort of. I haven't done the research, but I am going to go out on a limb here and say that this movie introduces four actors / actresses that went on to greater fame: Fran Drescher ("The Nanny"), Tony Danza and Michelle Pfeiffer (both household names), and Robert Wuhl (HBO's "Arle$$"). What's funny, but not really all that surprising given the reputation of this movie, is whenever an article is written about any one of these actors, this film is never EVER mentioned in their history of screen credits. (To them and their publicists I say: OH GROW UP! This movie wasn't THAT bad!) So if you're a fan of this movie, buy the DVD and place it proudly next to your copies of "Animal House", "Airplane", and "Caddyshack". (Oh yeah, you might as well put it next to your box sets of "The Naked Gun" and "Austin Powers" movies.) If you a just a fan of this genre, but not quite sure you want to fork over about $15 or so, rent it - if you can find it. And if you still don't like it, well, maybe you just need to hear Newbomb Turk's version of "Volare" a few more times . . .</comment>

    <title>Terrible product</title>
    <comment>Was excited to get this one home and see how fast it was. After configuring the router with my vaio I turned the wlan switch I got a blue screen and the pc crashed. This is it now ALWAYS does so I cannot use the router. Spending 20 minutes to get through to an alleged live person only to be told that it was nothing to do with them (I've had the vaio for 3 years, and 4 different routers and never had this problem) left me fuming. This router may end up costing me several hundred dollars to repair - stick with Linksys or Netgear!</comment>

    <title>Worthless Piece of Junk</title>
    <comment>I bought this product along with a Yamaha RX-V661BL receiver from Best Buy. A configuration recommended on BestBuy.com. Without the Rocketfish unit, all speakers including the rear ones in the the surround system worked just fine. With the Rocketfish unit hooked up, the Rocketfish transmitter and the Yamaha receiver would shut off every time sound was sent to the rear speakers. I exchanged the original Rocketfish unit for a new one at Best Buy (no problem, Best Buy was very helpful) and the new unit has the exact same problem. Rocketfish technical support was totally useless. I give up. I am going to get a refund at Best Buy tonight.</comment>

    <title>I liked it...</title>
    <comment>If I recall correctly, I listened to this album somewhere around 5 or 6 times the day I bought it. The problem with this CD is that some of the songs are so good, that a few of the other songs just don't compare. 'How I Disappear' and 'Sleep' are some of the best songs they've ever put out, and 'Cancer' is a brutally honest look at what it's about. (Also a really strange feeling if you've seen them perform it live) There is some growth from "Three Cheers.." to this CD, and as the other reviewer says, it's about the music on this release. And they do quite a job of it. The songwriting and arrangements are great.</comment>

    <title>A totally engrossing show...</title>
    <comment>If you've heard anything about House, it's likely good. The show blends mystery elements from shows like CSI into a medical setting with a misanthropic lead that's strangely hard to hate. Every main character is given a good amount of development time, so each is almost as engrossing as House himself. The show will have you hooked. If you're buying the box set, be careful as the 3 dual-sided discs make it something that requires you to be extra cautious with them.</comment>

    <title>Leatherface Never Looked So Good!</title>
    <comment>It is pretty widely accepted that no one will ever be able to match the gritty, documentary-gone-wrong feel of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and this movie does not try to. Instead, it turns a classic story into a visual masterpiece. While it uses its fair-share of horror movie conventions, it breaks through many of them by not only using blood and gore (trust me, there is still a lot of it) and a simplistic "run for your lives" storyline, but also visually interesting and almost poetic filmmaking. This movie scared a lot of people, despite that fact that half of it takes place during daytime/dusk. I think that is impressive in itself. Leatherface chasing you at night while you can't see 10 feet in front of you and popping out of the dark will always make you jump. Leatherface chasing you though a laundry line full of white sheets while the sun is still in the sky and you can see everything around you is just darn cool to watch! In addition, this movie has a great cast. The hallmark of a TCM film is not only a good Leatherface (which this film has) but a seriously disturbing group of family and friends to match in psychological horror what Leatherface accomplishes in physical horror. To this end, R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) and the rest of the Hewitt family deliver wonderfully sadistic performances. (If you want to see them take these performances to the next level, check out The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning which focuses much more on them) Jessica Biel and all of her traveling companions/victims also delver good performances. Despite that fact that most of them are clearly defined as cookie-cutter horror movie archetypal characters within the first three minutes of the movie, they all deliver believable performances (as far as each of their character-types allow). In my opinion, this is all you can ask for in a 90 minute scare-fest of a movie like this one. The fact that the villains are arguably better developed than the victims is in my opinion, a credit to the filmmakers' ability to focus on what interests and ultimately scares the audience. Put all of this together and you get some seriously disturbing stuff executed through an involving and visually stunning movie. The documentary about Ed Gein is pretty interesting, too. This along with the other special features makes the special edition a must-have for any true TCM fan. Check out The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning if you like this one; or if you wish you could see more of R. Lee Ermy and the rest of the Hewitt family. It's a little more gritty and less artistic, but a great ride, none-the-less.</comment>

    <comment>The Truth About Charlie is a pretty good movie. I think more people would have liked it if it wasn't a re-make of Charade. Charade was a much better movie, but I think this movie is worth watching. Hopefully, you'll agree with me.</comment>

    <title>CLASSIC. TRUE SHOOT TO KILL WESTERN</title>
    <comment>This is the one that started it all. One of my most favorite movies of all time. Dark, gritty, realistic portrayl of the west and life during that time. This film featured for the first time in cinema history a gun shooting and people getting shot in the same frame. Prior to this movie, the gun shot and person being shot had to be cut in differnt frames for censorship. GREAT storyline. Eastwood portrays what became his "anti-hero, vilgilanti" persona with his tradmark squint. THE ULTIMATE REALISTIC WESTERN. LOTS OF SHOOTING</comment>

    <title>A+ Charger in My Books</title>
    <comment>This charger has gained a nice mark in my books. Sure there are several other chargers out there, but is there one as low as this that INCLUDES batteries, can change between AA/AAA, and has the famous Duracell brand to it? I'm into photography, computer applications, traveling and hiking/camping so the point that this doesn't cost an arm and a leg and has a decent charge time makes it well worth it.</comment>

    <title>Great Tenacious D design</title>
    <comment>If you like Tenacious D songs and the first movie then you will love this one The only reason I gave it a 4 Star rating is that this is not for everyone. The language is not for those against cursing and also a provacative scene towards the end. If you are not offended and like Jack Black give this movie a try, rent it and you will probably end up buying it like me.</comment>

    <title>AWESOME!!!!</title>
    <comment>Both Ashley and Michael give stunning and believable performances in this creative psychological thriller. People with open minds will certainly appreciate this film. It is a little slow but it works toward a terrifying, dramatic and totally crazy climax. Which is totally awesome and really scary, because it could really happen to someone. I love this movie and went to the theatre 3 times to see it. I would totally recommend this movie to anyone who wants to stay on the edge of their seat guessing, and become totally mystified by the human mind and how fragile some of them really are.</comment>

    <comment>i have been waiting for chris to get back to the true acoustic sound. this is my favorite cd by DC. the melodies and lyrics have developed over the years, and dashboard confessional proves they can cover many genres with this album. i've been a fan of dashboard confessional from the near start, i've bought every album, excluding the orange ep record, but, no doubt, a must-buy album to complete any collection of music! Love Dashboard!!!</comment>

    <title>Great Series</title>
    <comment>Ghost Whisperer is a good series that although it can be repetitive as Jennifer Love Hewitt's character basically helps someone cross over in each episode, the drama and writing still makes it a solid series. The DVD is good and contains a few commentaries and featurettes that are worth it for the fans. I don't regret buying this DVD at all.</comment>

    <title>OK Movie</title>
    <comment>I thought the movie was just alright both times I saw it (with and without the 2-feature Grindhouse). I liked that the lap dance scene was included and the final climax was great. However, to those who hate that this isn't a part of the Grindhouse experience, I've read that this was the plan all along... from Tarantino. Grindhouse was only intended for a States release while Planet Terror and Death Proof were going to be released separately all along overseas. It was also the intent of doing the same on DVD. So, I have no problem with paying for both separately since you're actually getting longer movies with some decent extras.</comment>

    <title>It sucks</title>
    <comment>Well forget what everybody else is saying about this movie, because it sucks. This movie did the same thing the first two did, which is character development. How many times do you have to express that Peter Parker loves Mary Jane, Harry hates Spiderman, and Spiderman saves the day. This movie was everywhere with no common plot that keeps everything together. It sucks, plain and simple. If you are a true fan of movies and Spiderman, than you know this movie really sucks</comment>

    <title>Will the real Spidey please stand up</title>
    <comment>Okay is it just me, but where are the one liners that we know and love. You know how Spidey usually swings in and while beating up the bad guys have those comical one liners that sets him apart from the other super-heroes. This movie is sucks, but Doc Oct is brillant and the only high point of the movie. The writers stayed true to his characters, but didn't care about the main character</comment>

    <comment>Raw, real, and to the point, this movie is a book report about America's love for violence, no matter what the area is. High point of this movie has to be the acting of Jada Pinkett. She really showed the love that most females in hood have. That's right, not females from the hood wants to be video vixen</comment>

    <comment>I was hooked on this show from the very beginning, and couldn't wait for the first season to be released on DVD. I am very excited it was brought back for a second season, although a short season, but hopefully we can get more viewers and it will be back for a full one next time!</comment>

    <title>Call me Ms Justice is gangster</title>
    <comment>Ms. Jackson wasn't good a down homegirl, but she did her best. I mean, she never lived in the hood, so you gotta give her a benefit of doubt. Now Ms. Regina King is the high point of the movie, with her acting with Chicago and crazy lines when she is drunk. Tupac is great a postal worker, who is fed up with the 9 to 5 and wants something new in life</comment>

    <comment>This movie is a good movie for anyone that loves action with a good story line. I didnt really know what to expect having all these stars together but I can never get tired of watching this movie. The downtown bank robbery/gun fight is awesome, especially with surround sound.</comment>

    <title>Best Movie You Never Heard Of</title>
    <comment>this movie is cool. i don't really dig movies that are kind of like musicals, but this one was awesome. The music makes you wanna get up and dance. I saw it a whiles back and I would recommend it to someone who wants to watch a great movie that they may not have heard of. The music is cool and it has Heather Graham in it as an adult star (even though there are no nude scenes), what else could someone ask for? A coke, a pickle, and some popcorn!</comment>

    <comment>This is a good remake with Samuel Jackson as Shaft and the addition of Jefferey Wright and Christian Bale as villians, was just a great combination. From beginning to the end, just non-stop action that have on your heels to see what happens next.</comment>

    <title>Be the last of this genre</title>
    <comment>Maybe its just me, but is kinda hard looking at Tyrese as a gangster when he first started in a Cocola commerical singing their jingle with a big smile. Not gangster, but I could be wrong. Ms Henson on the other hand is just beautiful, and not because she gets nake but her acting had me interested in seeing the ending. One last thing, Snoop gains some weight</comment>

    <comment>I dont care if you are old, young, male or female this movie is amazing. It has comedy action and even a couple girly parts. I grew up with Transformers and have been waiting for this movie for a very long time. It was done brilliantly. Bring on Transformers 2 in 2009!!!!!</comment>

    <title>Rootin' Tootin' Val Lewton</title>
    <comment>With 9 movies and a documentary highlighting the career of the great producer, this set is full of atmospheric treasures. One key reason for purchase is The Body Snatcher, based off a Robert Louis Stevenson work, which is the last screen pairing of horror greats Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi (although Bela's role is far too small). Any fan of Karloff and/or Lugosi needs this. Continuing pleasure for Karloff fans is the inclusion of The Isle of the Dead and Bedlam. These are not the greatest of his films by any means, but rather, a completist's delight. Honestly, all of the movies in this set are great fun. If you enjoyed the classic Universal Horror flicks, these RKO titles are sure to satisfy.</comment>

    <title>Good album!</title>
    <comment>Want to hear what old rap was like back in the days of Notorious B.I.G/Tupac? If so, then this album is for you. Loaded with hard hitting beats that you can surely sing along with this c.d. is one of the best all time. This album features some of Biggie's best hits ("Mo Money Mo problems" "Hypnotize" "Last Day" "Nasty Boy") and many more. Definetely recommend purchasing this album if your into more old school rap than todays rap. One of the best albums in my opinion and I'm sure you will enjoy it as well!</comment>

    <title>BEST 07 SUMMER MOVIE MUST BUY</title>
    <comment>This movie was an awesome movie. After I saw it in theaters it was all I thought about for the next couple of days. I was ready to see it again, but didnt. The movie is action packed all the way through...you will not get bored trust me. The special effects are top notch and everything looks realistic. The cars/vehicles were all awesome. There were plenty of funny moments in the movie which are always good to have in a movie, even one as action packed is this. The acting was great, Shia LeBouf has definetely become an excellent actor, and newcomer Megan Fox is SUPER HOT! I definetely recommend this movie.</comment>

    <title>Great Game Still</title>
    <comment>This is the best game to come out on the original Xbox. It was a great follow up to the original Halo. Halo 2 brought you better graphics as well as dual wielding of weapons. The story line in campaign mode was awesome and continues on what already was a great story. Any Halo fan that is now playing Halo 3 should have played this and Halo Combat Evolved before playing Halo 3. Halo 2 also brought you the first introduction to the best online multi-player system that is around. Halo Combat Evolved did not have online multi-player. You can't argue with the fact that before Halo 3 was released this was the most played online game on Xbox Live, up until Halo 3's release. The graphics are still impressive and the gameplay was fantastic. Any FPS fan I recommend you play this game. Also this and Halo Combat Evolved are both Backward Compatible on the Xbox 360.</comment>

    <comment>Knocked up is a great movie. You will not stop laughing as it is funny from start to finish. This version of the movie contains some extra laughs. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you need to. It will not be a waste of your time at all. Highly recommend this to anyone.</comment>

    <title>Great Album</title>
    <comment>If you want to hear 50 Cent/the members of G-Unit at their best, then this is the album for you. Loaded with hits this c.d. is great if you just want something good to listen to. Nice beats and really good songs. I'd recommend buying the explicit version as the edited one ruins the songs. Overall, really good songs on here and basically Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and 50 sing in every song, like a verse each. Great c.d. and would definetelly recommend it to any G-Unit/50 Cent fan.</comment>

    <title>One of A Trilogy</title>
    <comment>This is one movie of a three movie Trilogy. The plot of this movie is basically a man who has forgotten completely about his past and is now trying to piece together what that past was. However the strange thing to him is that he has abnormal abilities in fighting and quick thinking skills. Bourne however does not understand why he has these abilities. After a short time though Bourne's ex-agency starts to come after Bourne and he has to fight to stay alive, as well as discover why the agency is chasing after him, as he does not remember who he was and how he is involved with them. You see both sides of the story from the agency that is chasing him, as well as Bourne's side. This movie contains some of the best action fight sequences that are very fast paced. This action movie isn't your regular shoot em' up, and never hit the good guy action flick. Bourne gets beat up a lot in this movie and isn't invincible like other action flicks. Guns are actually not very widely used in the movie as there is a lot of hand to hand combat mixed with handguns. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in action movies. There are almost always a great car chase in each of the movies as well with non-traditional vehicles used in the chases such as old Mini-coopers, no sports cars here. Great Movie and if you like the movie check out the books as they offer a completely different story than the movies.</comment>

    <title>Great stand</title>
    <comment>Once we got the stand setup the rest was a breeze! We installed a 50" Panasonic plasma on this stand's included mounting hardware without a single issue. The cable management included worked flawlessly for 2 HDMI, 1 fiber, 1 power, and 1 smaller radio antenna wire as well with room to spare. Very modern design. Only con to this unit is the build time. All required tools were included. Heed the warning in the instructions to wait on tightening the screws until you're to that point in the directions!!!</comment>

    <title>SHE'S ON HER OWN</title>
    <comment>I DIDNT BUY KELLY'S DEBUT ALBUM, ONLY FOR THE REASON THAT I WASNT REALLY A FAN OF HER. I MEAN ONE OF THOSE SONGS WAS AIGHT BUT IT WASNT ENOUGH TO MAKE ME WANNA RUSH TO THE STORE AND PICK IT UP AND IT WAS ALSO A LITTLE TOO POP FOR ME; I NEED A PERFECT BALANCE LIKE RIHANNA AND CIARA DO. THIS ALBUM HOWEVER IS UNBELIEVABLE; THIS ALBUM REALLY MADE ME FALL IN LOVE WITH KELLY EVEN MORE. I ALREADY LOVE BEYONCE' FOR THE TYPE OF ARTIST SHE IS AND NOW I CAN LOVE AND RESPECT KELLY FOR THE TYPE OF ARTIST THAT SHE IS. IVE HEARD OTHERS SAY THAT HER ALBUM ISNT LIKE BEYONCES SOPHOMORE ALBUM B'DAY, BUT MY THING IS JUST BECAUSE SHE HAPPENS TO BE A MEMBER OF THE ALL GIRL MULTI-PLATINUM SUPERGROUP DESTINY'S CHILD DOESNT MEAN SHE IS REQUIRED TO BE BEYONCES TWIN AS A SOLO ARTIST; THAT WOULDNT MAKE HER A SOLO ARTIST. THE FIRST FOUR TRACKS ON "MS. KELLY" ARE MORE UP-BEAT THAN THE LAST EIGHT, BUT THAT'S OKAY WITH ME AND I PREFER MORE UP BEAT TRACKS WHICH SHOWS HOW GREAT OF AN ARTIST SHE IS. MY FAVORITE SONG(S) WOULD HAVE TO BE "COMEBACK" "FLASHBACK" "WORK" AND "EVERY THOUGHT IS YOU". I ACTUALLY LOVE EVERY SINGLE TRACK, BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD NARROW IT DOWN. TRUST ME ONCE YOU GO AND BUY "MS. KELLY" YOU WONT HAVE TO PRESS THE SKIP BUTTON BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA WANNA HEAR EVERY LAST SONG FROM BEGINNING TO END. YALL TRUST ME YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED, KELLY IS AT HER BEST WITH THIS ALBUM; SHE'S ON HER OWN WITH THIS ONE....AND ALWAYS SAY "MS." BEFORE U MENTION HER NAME.</comment>

    <title>What a classic</title>
    <comment>This movie is fantastic...I have been waiting for years for the trilogy to be out on DVD so that I can purchase it...sure brings back memories, let me tell you Megan Follows is superb as the vivacious yet stubborn red head...I can't imagine anyone else playing that role and Jonathan Crombie as the handsome Gilbert Blythe...I remember when I first saw this movie with my sister on the Disney Channel we were constantly fighting over who had the biggest crush on Gilbert Blythe... this movie has become one of my favorite movies of all time...whoever purchases this trilogy will not be disappointed at all...the actors are superb and to have Miss Cadberry played by Megan Follows real mother is like a dream.. what a dream cast of actors Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! it is well worth it, and it would make a wonderful gift.</comment>

    <comment>I got halo 3 after I had played both halo and halo 2. I never carried much for them but still wanted to give halo 3 a try. I play for a week and got really bored with it. Online with 3 friends was fun untill you played it all. The other online s*ucked it was the same as halo 2 still people jumping around! I found that to take no skill at all. I am going to stick to playing rainbow six online because you have to be able to plan an attack or your dead.</comment>

    <title>Targus 4-Port USB 2.0 Notebook ChillHub</title>
    <comment>I bought this chillhub for my laptop and one of the fan started malfunctioning after 2 weeks. It works now and then but when it does, it makes loud, whirring noise which is very distracting. I'm dissatisfied with this product because I think it's too fragile. Yes, it performs its function of cooling the laptops but this is definitely not durable. I find myself unhappy with most of the Targus products because I bought a Targus mouse before and had to exchange it for a different brand since it stopped working after few weeks.</comment>

    <title>Waste of time</title>
    <comment>Purchased the kit, it was simple to set up. Red lights immediately went solid so communication should be established. No sound. Returned the product thinking it was defective. New kit, same story. Checked every possible wire connection, even changed out to different wires. Found the customer support line, after having to supply personal information, they told me if the red lights are solid, the product is working, end of story. I should take it back to Best Buy is their response. Too much time has been wasted already, it is being returned for good and I am out the $10 shipping and handling I paid.</comment>

    <title>Smoking on around friday</title>
    <comment>You would think that after Chris Tucker decided that he was too big for the Friday Series that it wouldn't be any good, but low and behold Ice Cube found another comedian to take over...Mike Epps. Not as good as the first but still a funny movie. With Pinky and Uncle Elroy, this series isn't going up in smoke</comment>

    <title>Awesome</title>
    <comment>I decided to purchase this router after reading numerous reviews on other websites besides BestBuy that comment about the performance of this router. I had a Netgear WNR-834B that would disconnect a lot had a weak signal. I returned the Netgear and replaced it with the D-Link instead. I noticed a dramatic performance increase via the ethernet connection to my desktop due to the 1gb ethernet. My laptop's performance increased dramatically also due to the fast wireless output of this router. I live in a single story 1,900sq feet home. I used to receive around 65%-80% signal when I was in the opposite side of the house with the Netgear. I am now getting 95%-100% signal!! I am amazed to get such a strong signal because I have had four routers in the past and I never used to get a signal beyond 85%. Setup was easy but I recommend that you immediately update the firmware to the newest version. The only negative things that I do not like is that the router does not have FTP support which might hopefully be added on future firmware releases and the lights are a bright annoying blue. Other than that, this router is for people that don't mind the price but want a high performance router.</comment>

    <title>A GIRL IS ON MY HAND?</title>
    <comment>Think about this your a kid going to school. Your punch is so stong is known as the Devil's Right Hand and one morning your wake up with a little girl insted of your right hand who has a crush on you (the girl). The days go form bad to worse when he goes to school with Midori Ozaki as his right hand. The plot gets deeper and deeper as he ties to get her off his hand. While her real body sleeps in her own bed as her "other" self is on this guy's hand (forgot his name). All in all its a good anime that will make you laught till your pink in the face or purple with a few people's cases.</comment>

    <comment>I know it took this cd a while to come out but it was worth the wait. If you are looking for a cd that's going to set the right mood for the night, you found it. If you are into the "Midnight Love" music, you have to get this. You won't be disappointed</comment>

    <title>FIFA 08 for Xbox 360 Big Improvement</title>
    <comment>This game is improved over the last couple years. Computer opponents react to your real time play instead of predictable motion. Player and ball physics are improved big time. Players running in one direction cannot stop on a dime and move in the other direction. Bottom line, if you were irritated with the depth, lack of teams, lack of skill moves, and other short comings of FIFA 06 and 07 you will be very pleased with this game. EA made an actual effort here. Those Winning Eleven fans finally have a reason to come back to FIFA where there is a perfect mix of gameplay and realism. Winning Eleven series is a little too deep for this avid long time fan of all soccer games.</comment>

    <title>Great buy @ BEST BUY</title>
    <comment>I researched online and found a great price. Before I purchased it i happened to stop in Best Buy. The price was better than online and there were plenty on hand. The employees were'nt much help but the layout makes it easy to shop. Awesome boost to system will get new kit to take me to 4GB. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>One of the best for Xbox</title>
    <comment>This is the first game in the Halo trilogy. It's also one of the best games you can buy for the Xbox besides Halo 2. Both Halo and Halo 2 are backward compatible on the Xbox 360 and this game is a must play to get one of the best storyline in this story. If you are looking for a great FPS this is a great game to buy. Especially at the price it is selling at now. This game still holds it's value. Especially if you are looking to revisit the storyline this game has. This game also has no multi-player option as it wasn't really out when this game was created. If you are interested in FPS's even today this game is still awesome to play.</comment>

    <title>Greatness</title>
    <comment>Loved every minute of this movie, with the mutant vs mutant action, mutant vs human action, special effects, plot, everything. The only problem is that they not establish the younger mutants, because some of these veteran actors may start talking about increasing their pay...hint Halle</comment>

    <title>Not so good</title>
    <comment>This movie was not as good as the first one, 28 Days Later. The plot needed some serious help. It just wasn't scarey and parts did not make any sense. They didn't even use the original cast that supposedly survived at the end.</comment>

    <comment>This is a classic story of a mob hit-man (Tom Hanks). The basic theme is a man getting revenge for his family being murdered. The original storyline coming from a comic book masterminds image. A must see for folks who enjoy a gangster family plot. Outstanding performances from the actors.</comment>

    <title>Great concert DVD.</title>
    <comment>This is just a straight up concert performance DVD. There are some hidden short films by the guys in the band that are very strange on this disk, and they interview fans in the bonus features. Overall this is a well shot, high energy show that AFI plays very well on. Definitely a must have for the AFI fan out there. The sound is well recorded and mixed, sounds excellent on a good surround system. The picture (albeit a bit grainy at times, but it looks artful - so no complaints here) is colorful and sharp!</comment>

    <title>Best Show Ever</title>
    <comment>This show truly has a writing staff that just gets it right every single time. This show had an amazing 1st season. The cast and crew are is made up of some of the best people out there. This show is one I truly feel i something no one should go without giving it a try. If you want great shows with amazing writing, cinematography, acting and action honestly this one has it all. Today tv shows with great writing and cinematography are hard to find especially with all the reality mess that there is now a days. Watch Jericho or atleast give it a shot you will be hooked. Im glad we helped this show get a 2nd season.</comment>

    <title>Awesome Game!</title>
    <comment>This game met my expectations completely. It is an AWESOME game and I really dont know what some of the people who are talking down about the game were hoping for. I mean, there are limitations - though playing this game it is hard to believe. I think that if you consider the Halo trilogy and compare to those games you will agree that this was by far the best and an excellent way to bring to an end such an awesome and popular series. Or is it the end.......?</comment>

    <comment>The second season of The Wild Wild West was brought to us in color as back then, everything on T.V. was adapting to homes having color televisions. What a treat it was to see our heroes James West and Artemus Gordon in Living Color! I believe it added even more depth to the show. See for yourself...</comment>

    <title>good job DC!!</title>
    <comment>I previewed the songs on DC's myspace page and at first, I wasn't quite sure if I liked the songs, but after a couple runs the songs really started to stand out and stick. A lot of energy, variation, and good old DC stuff! some favorite lines: if you knew what i know would you try? before your time has run on you and worn you down... is there time? is there time? to follow just one desire?</comment>

    <title>SHE ON FIRE!!!!!</title>
    <comment>LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM MADE ME THINK OF DESTINY'S CHILD ONLY...ZERO TIMES...SHE REALLY STEPPED OUT OF THAT REALM AND BEGAN TO OWN HER OWN SOLO CRAFT. I THINK THAT IS SOMETIMES BETTER FOR PEOPLE TO DO ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE THE LEAD SINGER ANYWAY. SHE USES SAMPLES FROM SOME OLD SCHOOL TRACKS AND I REALLY LOVE THE SMOOTH AND SLOW FEEL OF THE ALBUM. YOU GET KINDA HYPHE WITH THE FIRST FOUR TRACKS AND THEN YOU JUST LAY BACK AND NOD YA HEAD TO THE REST OF THE CD. ITS A CD YOU CAN SING ALONG TO AND I LUV IT. MY FAVORITE TRACK (AT THE MOMENT) HAS GOT TO BE THE TRACK CALLED "YES." DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE MIGHT HAVE CAME OUT A FEW YEARS AGO, BUT IF YOU STILL DONT HAVE MAKE SURE YOU GO TO BESTBUY AND PICK UP A COPY BECAUSE IT LIVES UP TO ITS NAME.</comment>

    <title>Certain people would love this!</title>
    <comment>I love Radiohead. I watched this documentary on Sundance channel years ago, and I was captivated! Grant Gee does an excellent job with this film, and the audio is almost just as good. Ominous, creepy tones play under interviews with a seemingly miserable band. Some concert footage is shown, not usually an entire song at a time. News footage and articles are shown, and it really follows a band as they are triumphed as the "best band" and how they react to it. Very honest dialogue, and great visuals. I wouldn't imagine very many people will watch this unless they are fans of Radiohead, but even if you're just interested in the music business you should check this out.</comment>

    <title>awful</title>
    <comment>The Boondock Saints tries to go the Tarantino route, but fails miserably. The vengeance motif is painfully overblown and contrived, complete with a brotherly prayer before each death. Willem Dafoe is wasted as a cop, even being featured in arguably the worst scene. He dramatically pieces together a crime scene, with classical music being played in the background. A terrible movie trying to be a Ritchie/Tarantino flick. Avoid at all costs.</comment>

    <title>Excellent Horror Movie with Best Cast</title>
    <comment>I really enjoyed the movie it was one of the best I have seen in a very long time. I really enjoyed every little detail of every character from beginning to the very end I give the movie 5 stars it was that good of a movie. The movie could have had a little more gore than it had but that is okay I really loved it anyway. It was the first time that I have seen it several months ago and I just loved it. The cast,the characters and the graphics along with the motive were excellent who would have thought it to be the way it was. Seriously if you never seen it go out and buyu it today because with the cast and everything you are sure to enjoy it. This movie really makes you sit on the edge of your seat when you are watching because you wonder what will happen next just thinking that it all has to do with a mere computer game that is just simply masterful.</comment>

    <title>Best Comic Horror!</title>
    <comment>This is a film in the tradition of Peter Jackson's "Dead Alive" and Sam Raimi's "Evil Dead." It stands on its own, however, and adds it's own level of gory fun. If you like a little humor with your gore then you shouldn't be disappointed with this one.</comment>

    <title>Nostalgic Goodness</title>
    <comment>This was a wonderful find for me. I was a huge fan of this show, eventhough i was only 10. The episodes are all entertaining for adults and most are kid friendly. My kids were absolutely laughing their heads off while watching "Mummy, Daddy". We watch an episode a night, and its been so long since I've seen them its like watching them for the first time all over again.</comment>

    <title>The Hood bring out the best in white people</title>
    <comment>This movie is okay, but falls in the same type of movies that came during that time...a white person going to the hood for a better life and a black person trying to leave the hood for a better life. Now there's nothing wrong with that concept, but when its done so much it gets boring. But top everything off little Onyx-Moesha's boyfriend-Bug, from Ride-Q from Sunset Park-Fedro Starr is trying to be a thug. Okay can we get another out-of-work rapper play a better thug, what about Craig Mack</comment>

    <title>Fantastic Bag !</title>
    <comment>I bought this bag for my Lumix FZ-18. Lovely bag with very useful compartments. Very light weight. An inch more on the inside camera compartment could be much more satisfying.</comment>

    <title>The misadventures of Han Solo</title>
    <comment>I guess I'm like most of the other critics on here that didn't see the TV series, but just like everyone else I feel the same way this is a great movie. I got on DVD and I will still watch it if it's on cable still. Yeah, I like it that much. The fight scenes are on point, and dare I say, "Greatness."</comment>

    <title>Nice game</title>
    <comment>Very nice gameplay w/ nice video settings once you get the right one...... There is no option to change your video settings! Unless you want to re-install the game 3 times like I did, hope you select the right one when it finally installs (about 15 min.) otherwise you'll be re-installing trying to find the right setting for it that goes well w/ your video card. I don't understand how EA could leave out that "small" detail???</comment>

    <comment>Talk about a desk organizer!?! These things are remarkable! Flawless, easy to use and install. Why spend extra money on monitors, speakers,mice and keboards just to clutter a desk? (provided your pc's are next to eachother). A pc builders dream tool too.</comment>

    <title>Good Headset</title>
    <comment>This is a good headset for online gaming. You won't have any problems speaking to and hearing your opponents. The best feature of this headset is that it stays put and is very lightweight. As some of the wireless headsets have been known to fall off your ear if you move to much. This headset's only downfall is that it's attached to the controller by a wire, and that gets annoying. Especially if you pause to get up, you have to constantly take it off, and put it back on, rather than just walking away like you would with a wireless headset. Overall a great headset I've never had a problem with it, and for the price you really can't argue with that.</comment>

    <title>Companion 2 series</title>
    <comment>At first I was looking at the mid level bose speakers. But after listening to these they changed my mind. I felt these more then covered what I needed at a much more afforable cost. I don't have much to say about these except they surprise me everyday. I thought the no woofer would be a problem. Trust me it isn't.</comment>

    <title>Great show, better than CSI in some respects</title>
    <comment>I didn't watch Criminal Minds until the second season and although I still enjoy CSI, this series is better in both the procedural aspects and giving their characters some background without taking away from the crimes. The DVD is good, much like Ghost Whisperer and CSI, as CBS provides some interesting features for the fans to enjoy.</comment>

    <comment>wow, this is one of the most under rated films of all time,(this one and Way Of The Gun). Everyone I showed it watches it over and over again. I have this account at the local rental store where I can get 3 movies free a day. I basically keep Shottas for the 3 week limit then re-rent it. Soundtrack might be the Best Ever</comment>

    <title>Wasted 2 Hours Of My Life</title>
    <comment>This movie was a major let down, I was expecting non stop action. Instead 80% of the movie was girls sitting around, well talking about girl stuff. This movie only had about 20 decent minutes of action. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.</comment>

    <title>ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!</title>
    <comment>I have a close friend who grew up in Huntington so I was drawn to this movie to see what really happened. I bought the DVD 2 weeks ago and have watched it 4 times and will watch it many more times in the future. It's a very emotional beginning leading up to the plane crash that claimed so many lives, but shows how a school that suffered such a terrible tradgedy bounced back because of some very determined students and faculty. I would suggest this movie to anyone who loves sports or is looking for a great feel good movie.</comment>

    <title>Great graphics/sound</title>
    <comment>This game uses the sixaxis controller for all movement...but overall the game is really boring...Same type of missions over and over again...The only thing that makes this worthwhile is that the graphics and sound are absolutely amazing for one who has a 1080p TV and 7.1 surround sound...other than that...there are better games out there. If you like monotony then this game is for you....</comment>

    <title>Michae Bay has done it again</title>
    <comment>Finally Transformers came to the theaters and Michael Bay decides the unthinkable, he doesn't use that much special effects as other directors use, which is a good thing. Think about how cartoonish Power Rangers, Godzilla, Wild Wild West and others looked like with so much special effects. The tranforming looked almost real and the plot was just on point. Greatness. Okay but what was up with Anthony Anderson's role, comic relief..no, intelligence...umm no, romance...heck no. NO real meaning for the whole movie.</comment>

    <comment>This is a typical date movie with a Hip/Hop remix, and no Puffy didn't have anything to do with it. If you love Hip/Hop like Sid (Lathan) does in this movie than you will enjoy this movie. Cabbie (Mos Def) is brilliant.</comment>

    <title>AC/DC Plugged In</title>
    <comment>Great box set of live AC/DC material. But it's all on DVD. There should have been cd's to go with it. Of course the best thing about the box set is that it features Bon Scott. He was the voice of AC/DC until his death. There are some never before scene concerts with Bon Scott on vocals. Finally, AC/DC gives fans what bootleggers have been trading in for years. Now where's that new cd with over 40 songs that Brian Johnson was talking about two years ago?</comment>

    <comment>The story picks up after the anime ends and rotates around Edward and our wrold during the second world war. It tells of how Ed adapts to our world of no alchemy and his belifes that he will meet his brother again. Al in their world has become much like his brother even down to the way he looks except height. Things start to go wrong when Hitler's wrokers start to try to go to another world and bring more power to him. As you could of guessed the other world is Ed's home and it starts to break holes in it as the 2 worlds break at times. Ed keeps tring to go to Al and he does the same and they do but at the cost of the Gate being held open and the brothers are together again and now have to fight the new threat to their world, thanks to Hitler's workers and thats all I'm saying for now. Its a really good movie end to a really good anime</comment>

    <title>Cannot Wait</title>
    <comment>I can't wait Mass Effect looks SOO good. Other amazing Bioware titles have never disapointed me. Like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Repubic or KOTOR. Best game so far. But I think Mass Effect will be better. If you have never heard of this or seen any videos, go here: masseffect.bioware.com Cant wait.</comment>

    <title>Yo- Ledisi is off the chainz!!!</title>
    <comment>I found out about Ledisi on a friend's myspace page. "Alright" was playing so I decided to check out her page. Being a musician myself, I was immediately drawn to her because the music was slamming. But then, listening to her voice and the lyrics/vocal arrangements I fell in love with her. I pre-bought her album on iTunes and also purchased it when it came out. If you appreciate real music you'll love this album!!!</comment>

    <title>Not a great movie</title>
    <comment>While this movie does serve up giant robots and pretty special effects, that's pretty much where the good points stop. the plot is thread bare, the acting is static at best and Bay spends way too much time on those wacky humans to the point of keeping anyone from really caring about the Autobots' war with the Decepticons. Add that Megatron gets, at best, a cameo appearance, and that the film strays very far from the source material (why is it hard to at least try and stay true to a properties roots?) and you get a film that is more flash than substance</comment>

    <title>Should have stopped at 2</title>
    <comment>X2: X-Men United was a fine example of how to stay true to a franchise while extrapolating enough from it to make a good movie. The themes dealt with in the second installment were resonant, relevant and well played out. Sadly, X-Men 3 denegrates into a sub-par action movie. Instead of really exploring the symbolism that the X-Men mythos embodies, the filmmakers instead choose to see how many mutants they can cram into one movie. None are really fleshed out and you have to wonder if this is just an attempt to market as many action figures as possible. Coupled with the pointless deaths of major characters and plot holes so big the Golden Gate Bridge could be floated through them and you get a movie that just throws away everything great its prequel was. Do yourself a favor and stop at X2. Pretend this one never happened.</comment>

    <title>Long Live the Lips</title>
    <comment>The Flaming Lips once again prove that all you need to produce a great album is talent and skill and that's just what At War With The Mystics is an exercise in. Unlike top 40 acts that are almost gleefully one-trick-ponies, The Lips have been around for decades, honing their skills, mastering their craft and getting better and better with each outing. At War is a fine rock'roll album that any fan of the genre would be remiss to do without. Great vocals, killer guitars and a political message that, while there, doesn't subvert the true purpose of the album, and that's to entertain the masses.</comment>

    <title>Laughs to spare in this holiday offering.</title>
    <comment>On the one hand, this is a movie based off of a computer game about hitting elves with bowling balls. On the other hand this Elf Bowling the Movie does raise an interesting theory about the origins of Santa Clause that I cannot help but find intriguing. Santa as a disenfranchised pirate who hones his skills until he can strike joy into the hearts of children around the world leaving nary a scrap of evidence he was ever there at all? Is Santa a joy ninja? A Pirinja? When is Bejeweled the Movie coming out?</comment>

    <title>emotional twister</title>
    <comment>An excellent movie with great visuals of the forbidden city and its' deffence. There are few action sequences so I would classify this as more of a drama martial arts movie, doused in the traditions of the royal family, and their bloody ambitions. I'm glad I own it, but not my favorite martial arts movie right now.</comment>

    <title>fun game</title>
    <comment>I enjoy this game. I play online, which is free. I have lots of characters built and I basically play to unwind. As far as the box set goes, well once you start playiing LOD you wont need D1, just not that great. D2LOD, is where the fun is. You have different levels, bosses, items to find or make. good stuff, check it out. It is a time stealer though!</comment>

    <comment>This was a fresh new type horror movie. I will not ruin this movie for you by telling you the synopsis. I will just tell you that the "Horrman" advises you too check this movie out. Fans of horror movies over the years will love this movie for its historical references too other horror icons and the great humor in this movie portrayed in a serious manner. Horrorman says go grab a copy of this, watch it and enjoy!!!</comment>

    <title>Garbage too the Horrorman!!!</title>
    <comment>On the cover of this movie somewhere, some quote is referenced in a way saying that this is the scariest movie since the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The movie is easy too follow, not scary. It makes a neat "based on a true story" story, but its not scary at all. The acting is not that good either. The fact that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was mentioned in a quote on the cover, made me skeptical of the movie before watching it, as the original TCM rules!!! So I wasnt let down as I expected this movie too be bad and it was. The Horrman says" Avoid This movie.. Its not good. Only get this movie if you want too increase your horror movie collection, and your are addicted too buying movies like me!!!"</comment>

    <comment>I saw this the night it came out, then saw it again 3 days later. I LOVED this film, and will have the special edition in my hands on October 16! If you haven't seen this yet, you really missed out, because seeing it in the theater was a great way to see it, because of the sound. I was afraid they would ruin one of my favorite cartoons as a child, but they didn't!</comment>

    <title>The game has bugs</title>
    <comment>I love the game. The graphics are awesome it's lots of fun, however: The game has known bugs that the makers are working on a patch for. Be aware that the game comes with secuROM, a controversial anti-piracy program made by Sony. Research and learn about SecuROM, to decide if you want it on your system, before you install.</comment>

    <title>New Voltron adventure for any fan</title>
    <comment>If you're a fan of Voltron this DVD should be in your collection. The story is based on the popular Voltron comic books with all your favorite characters from the tv show returning. My kids enjoyed it and the DVD includes a version where the dialog appears on the screen as it is spoken so the kids can read along as the video plays. Cannot wait for the next DVD in the series. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Excelent, worth every penny</title>
    <comment>Well, first, lets just start off with the sets ONLY con, the fact that it has USB instead of standard speaker cords. Because i have alot of USB stuff, i had to trade off because there was no open USB port, so i had to ditch the gaming controler :(, but it was worth it. Now to the good stuff........ First, Bose will not let you down, these speakers rock. As for 5.1 sound, they create a very convincing sound setting, while watching movies i can hear sounds around me..... and i look to find no speaker there, just two in the front. Its an amazing system. Because of these speakers, i prefer watching movies on my computer, instead of watching them on my dad's much more expensive Dolby system. Sound Quality is very very high with these speakers, you will hear things that you never heard before because other speakers could not handle those sounds, the sound quality is consitent from the softest to the loudest volume. The sound quality is the main reason i bought these speakers, you will be amazed.... but remember, these speakers are limited to the quality of the music or game sound that your playing, but if you have high quality music and game stuff, you will be amazed. Size, they are perfect, they save alot of room compared to full 5.1 systems (while delivering just as much sound). The two speakers fit neatly on my desk, and the acustimas module is very compact and saves floor space. In fact, while being on the small side, the bass with this system pumps out just as much if not more sound than most 5.1 systems. Even without the bass, the speakers can handle alot of bass on they're own, they are just amazing. Quality of construction, very very good, the speakers and the bass are builit well, and built to last. The speakers are on metal stands...... yes, metal, (probibly aluminum) compared to other systems cheap plastic speakers). The speakers themselves are magneticly sheilded, and also built very strong, the bass is very solid too. This is a true entusiasts system. I had a hard time finding any plastic parts on the outside of the system, every thing is made of metal of very hard, high quality plastic. Although i cant tell you if the circutry inside the system is as tough as its shell, i would go dropping them just incase somthing inside becomes loose. Overall, i would recomend it to anyone who admires quality craftsmanship and good sound. Pros: EXCELENT sound quality Tough construction, the sub is build like a tank Very good representation of directional sound Wide soundstage for 2channel music and games Surprisingly good 5.1 sound for movies and some games. Overall, these are possibly the best speakers you can buy for PC, i recommend them completely. Cons: USB means you have one less spot for game controlors, etc, that also take USB. But that doesnt really matter anymore once you hear the speakers.</comment>

    <title>Good cd, comparable to anthony green's vox</title>
    <comment>Very diverse sountrack, from soft to strong, slow to fast. If you enjoyed their previous EP featuring Anthony Green, I have no doubt in my mind that you will enjoy this just as much, if not more, with the new vocalist. Check them out on myspace or PV first, though, if you're iffy.</comment>

    <title>A must have</title>
    <comment>This is a perfect adapter for anyone with a MacBook laptop. Since the MacBook laptops do not come with a VGA or DVI fullsize output this adapter allows you to connect an external monitor or a projector. You can use the monitor to extend the desktop for a much larger working area or just use it as a double display. It can support a 1400x900 resolution monitor. The clarity it produces is great and fast refresh rates are available. With this product the possibilities are endless. For the price you can not get any better. There are also different adapters to connect to regular DVI or to a RCA video or S-video source. Exceptional value for a low price.</comment>

    <title>the ultimate purchase</title>
    <comment>I have been a fan since season 1 episode 1. There was no way in the world i would miss a show when it came on. I had my grandmother and sister watching also. I am so glad they finally released season 2, now i can't wait for 3 and 4. Since its not on showtime anymore for new shows i want to be able to remember the good times. Everyone should enjoy them too.</comment>

    <title>Does what FIFA does well</title>
    <comment>All the options, offical names and kits you expect with FIFA. Plays a bit more like pro evo than past versions and the quiz mode and keep ups are a nice diversion. Goalkeeper control is also allowed and it is possible to score some brilliant looking goals, shame the replays never go back far enough to do them credit. If you're a fan of previos FIFA's on other platforms it does all you will expect with a few nice additions to keep you busy. Enjoy, esp the stadiums - they look VERY good.</comment>

    <title>Fufillment of the Triology</title>
    <comment>This is the best game i have ever bought. Aside from the fact that the campain only lasts 10 levels, it is an awesome game. Since it is played on Xbox 360 you all ready know that the color, sound, and picture quality will be fantastic. But the graphics almost seemed real the first time I played. It seems to be like you areactually in the game fighting along with mastercheif. The campain features many different level layouts; i.e. snow, sunset, in the air, fighting in vehicals, shooting down phantoms. Playing in the forge mode allows you to edit the map while you play. You can also move things like cars, weapons, starting points. But you can also even buy more objects. Overall this is the best game ever; also the best triology ever. - Halo, Halo 2, &amp; Halo 3. thnks Bungie.</comment>

    <title>Watch out, fellow Simmers</title>
    <comment>This is an excellent premise for a game, so I bought it. There is a hidden program, however, called SecuROM that gets installed on your computer without you knowing and you can't remove it without damage to your computer. My computer completely crashed after installing Bon Voyage on it, and still is not 100% after reformatting. I would go to the forums at Sims2.com and read up on the pros and cons of the game before deciding whether or not to buy this game. A lot of people have a lot of damage to their computer due to SecuROM. Also see Wikipedia.</comment>

    <title>Horrible</title>
    <comment>I think that metroid prime 3 corruption is million times better than this. Besides the fact that you can talk to people over the internet, this game really sucks. I don't see how these games do so well. I'm all Metroid Prime 3. They even had a Samus vs. Master Chief on ign.com and Samus won by a whoppping 70 something percent while Master Cheif had a pitiful 20 something percent. Samus is better.</comment>

    <title>Very Disappointing</title>
    <comment>I saw this movie on opening weekend with a few friends and I gotta say it was very disappointing. The past 2 movies were actually pretty good but the way they out it together was terrible since it didn't describe anything about Venom and he just died which was lame. They shouldn't have put Sandman on there and just put in Venom and had the movie pretty much all about him and i suppose Hob-Goblin. Those who are Spider-Man fans such as myself have to say it was poorly made but if you went to go see it because you started liking Spider-Man as soon as the first one came out, I guess it was alright.</comment>

    <title>Extremely Funny Movie!!</title>
    <comment>I never saw this movie in theaters even though I really wanted to but a few of my friends told me about it as well as my big brother. So I went to go buy it the first day it came out and I don't regret buying this at all. This has got to be the funniest movie I've seen this year. It's just about a random dude who hooks up with this hot chick at a club and get a bit drunk and she ends up having a kid. It goes during the entire 9 months of how they're trying to get to know each other with absolutely hilarious results. Those who haven't seen this yet have to go out and buy it. Trust me this will have you laughing from beginning to end!!</comment>

    <title>Sickest Horror Movie Ever!!!!</title>
    <comment>I first saw this movie when ny friend let me borrow it. Once I was finished seeing it, I honestly had to go and buy it right away. Those who are looking for a great horror movie, look no further because you just found it. This movie never ever gets old just all the blood and violence in this is so sick you just want to keep watching. It keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire movie and the whole thing starts right away so there's no waiting for the non-stop horror.</comment>

    <comment>This was actually a really good movie, I expected it to be an ok movie kind of weird. This has to be a must-see for people who are looking for a good horror/action/thriller movie since it was great. I gotta say WWE Films make some pretty good movies. I'll be looking forward for newer movies from them.</comment>

    <comment>The campaign mode, both solo and co-op is fantastic. Lots of fun extras like humorous AI quotes. The storyline is great and graphics are pretty good. Unfortunately the online team matches are spoiled by bad sportsmanship conduct by most players on this Halo craze. Sad to see such a great game ruined online by immature people.</comment>

    <comment>I was tired of renting a steam cleaner every couple of months to clean my carpet. I have 2 large dobermans in the house who are eager to make a mess, and not to mention a husband!! I wasn't sure what I was looking for so I just went to the nearest Best Buy. The salesman was very helpful and seemed to know exactly what I was looking for. The Clean Surge is wonderful at getting deep down dirt. I was so excited about how well it cleaned I had the entire house cleaned in about 2-3 days! This was definitely a GREAT investment!!</comment>

    <title>Great Movie!</title>
    <comment>This movie was a great watch. It takes a different perspective by showing you the bad guy's view of things instead of the good guy's. Through this, one can find a new way of thinking about what truely is suspense. The movie keeps you waiting for the climax, and when it happens, its amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who is into finding different turns on genre films. Much better than the American remake.</comment>

    <title>Must Have!</title>
    <comment>At first when i bought all the controllers for the Wii, i was worried that i had to keep a stack of batteries ready so i could enjoy the play time with the family. With the Nyko Charge Station i didnt have to invest so much money on replacement AA batteries. I have it set up next to the wii and it matched nicely. I have 4 remotes and it was difficult to find extra batteries for the other two. Finally gave up and ended up buying another charge station. Now I can charge all 4 remotes and have them ready for the family to play.</comment>

    <title>Not quite worth the money.</title>
    <comment>Guitar Hero: Rock the 80s is quite simply a thrown-together cash-grab effort. It's Guitar Hero 2 with some cheap 80s neon thrown in. Not only are there no new characters or venues, there are actually LESS than GH2. Ridiculous. Characters all have one new outfit, nothing more. That's not to say it's not fun. There are quite a few extremely enjoyable songs. Turning Japanese is a blast. Only a Lad, Synchronicity II, classic. The last tier is mint: Electric Eye, Police Truck, Seventeen, Caught in a Mosh, Play With Me. All fun. There are a few questionable choices. There's an horrendous cover of Radar Love, and the extremely boring and lame Heat of the Moment. Who was asking to play a song by Ratt? Because, It's Midnite by fake 80s band Limozeen would have been a bonus track on any other GH version. Here, it's an encore. There are absolutely no bonus tracks; a severe letdown, as the bonus tracks were one of the more enjoyable aspects of the first two games, that also exposed people to lesser known bands. At $50, it's quite simply a ripoff. If you can get it cheap, or borrow it from a friend, it's worth it. Though I suppose if you're a diehard like myself, you'll pay whatever it takes to get new songs. We're all slaves to Activision, and they'll charge whatever they want. Live with it.</comment>

    <title>Best Series Ever</title>
    <comment>First of all, this comment may contain a few small SPOILERS about plot lines related to Veronica Mars. Just warning anyone who reads it....... Overall, I rate this product at a 5 out of 5. The storyline of Veronica Mars is very thrilling and kept me hooked. I LOVED the first season and thought that the bus crash story was an ever better topic than the murder of Veronica's best friend. Both had surprising outcomes in the end, but I thought the culprit behind the bus crash was more surprising than the murderer of Veronica's friend. This series has some great acting all around, especially from Kristen Bell, my favorite actress. : ) I would recommend this series to anyone who likes a good mystery, drama, and sharp witty humor wrapped up into one series. This show has it all!</comment>

    <comment>I am a person that does not buy a lot of CD's. Howevery, he was at a local radio station and they where playing "teasers" of his new songs from his new album. I was hooked after hearing that. Almost every song was FANTASTIC! I wrote in my planner to go to Best Buy on OCT 2nd to pick up a copy. I bought it and popped it and to my CD player and new it was a great buy!</comment>

    <comment>Carnival Games is a fun way to challenge yourself or complete with friends. The game has the feel of the carnival games we all love playing. Most games are very easy to play, but hard to win. My only disapointment was that I had to create a character in the game and could not use my Mii.</comment>

The rubber pad helps prevent clothing from sliding off the top. But note that the work surface cannot be ironed on. The manual clearly states this, but nowhere in the advertising did it mention this. There's also a removable sticker on the work surface warning you not to iron on it. If ironing was possible I would have rated it 5 stars.</comment>

    <title>Foo Rocks!</title>
    <comment>Foo Fighters never disappoint. Each album has it's own unique character. This release shows both the hard and soft side of the band, which I really like. I think this is the best Foo Fighters album in years.</comment>

    <title>Dexter for President</title>
    <comment>This show flat out rocks. I had never seen an episode, of this show till I bought the first season on dvd. Needless too say I watched the whole series in 2 sets of 6 hr blocks. I loved it, and you will. Dexter is a likeable character and it is great too even watch his basic interactions with people. The Horrorman says " If you like good stuff, you will like Dexter. Dexter is good stuff!!!"</comment>

    <title>Good action, great FX</title>
    <comment>The storyline was a very good sequel, better than most, and the return of Dr. Doom was predictable. The name of the title character - Silver Surfer - is lame but fits (this is a comic book). The story premise - an intergalactic world-eating monster - is fantastic and the speed with which it moves between solar systems and galaxies is way beyond our present knowledge of the speed of light. Although there is one scene in which faster than light tachyons are used to defeat Dr. Doom and "knock" him off the Surfer's board. Overall, the movie strains the limits of physics and astronomy but it makes for a good story.</comment>

    <comment>This show is amazing. If you are not a football fan, you do not have too be in order too like it. This show deals with football, but the show is about life, passion, and is just a superb show. Give it a shot on dvd and watch the new season. You will not be let down.</comment>

    <title>Great CD &amp; DVD</title>
    <comment>The DVD is a live recording and is done very well. Jeremy keeps on track and doesn't get off on long instrumentals like so many other live recordings. Also introduces some of the songs with alot of class. The CD is the same songs without any the talk that comes between songs on the DVD. Just some fine comtempory Christian music with an outstanding finishing song "This Man" It is one of the most powerful songs I have heard.</comment>

    <comment>Weeds season 2 is even better than season 1. Who would have thought that was possible. You do not have too be a fan of marijuana too like this show. This show is comedic but real and deals with many issues in life. Brilliant cast, writing and Mary-Louise Parker is flat out amazing.</comment>

    <title>A Great Inspirational Movie</title>
    <comment>This is one of the Best inspirational movies I've seen in quite a long time. Based on a True Story of Race Intigration in the School in the early 70's in Virgina, "Remember the Titans" shows that if you work as a team, there is nothing that can't be overcome. I highly recomend this movie to anyone weather they like Football or not.</comment>

    <title>Not Bad, but.....</title>
    <comment>This double oven is very large and has shelves which glide in and out easily. The door is a full window for viewing. Unfortunately, preheat time is lengthy. The control panel does not allow you to view what is going on in each oven at the same time. There is only one timer vs one for each oven, so you must have a separate timer if cooking in both. Using the start, on, and off buttons are cumbersome. Baking has been even and the convection feature is great! I would compare operational features with other brands before buying this oven.</comment>

    <title>Extremely Happy</title>
    <comment>I've been searching for something like this for a while. Definitely worth its price. Easy installation. Versatile setup with front speakers as well. I was playing around and configured the front speakers to work off of it and the sound quality was great too. The sound gain of the receiver is a great feature to set up the surround levels without changing your system settings. As long as the units are paired on different wireless codes I am willing to get another unit and install it in my other home theater room.</comment>

    <title>Great Visuals - Poor Actors</title>
    <comment>If you are looking for a movie featuring armor and slaughter, then this one is for you. The camera work is good - the mood and atmosphere created could make for an epic tale. Clancy Brown (antagonist) is the only great actor among them, the rest are weak including the main character. Definately a hack-fest.</comment>

    <comment>Season Six of the Gilmore girls too me was the lowest rated one of them. I would give it a 4.5/5 comparing it too the other seasons. The writing dipped a little in this season, but not enough for the new viewer too notice. When comparing season 6 too other tv shows.. this show still stands way above the rest!!!</comment>

    <title>Less Eventful Than Fiction</title>
    <comment>It's an interesting premise: ho-hum IRS agent Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) realizes his every ritualistic move - from tying his tie in a single Windsor knot to brushing his teeth seventy-six times - is being narrated by an omniscient female with a British accent (Emma Thompson). Besides his initial confusion, Harold doesn't really have a problem with this, until the voice mentions his "imminent death." Enlisting the help of a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman) and a tax-evading baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Harold sets out on a quest to save his own life in this sweet but flawed comedy. Marc Forster's quirky shooting style is colorful and engaging and suits the film perfectly, appropriate considering some of his previous work (Finding Neverland, Stay). Traditionally mind-numbing office scenes and city-spanning mass-transit excursions are jazzed up by clever camera angles, as well as by floating, computer-generated illustrations of what's really going on in Harold's brain. The fiercely talented cast is one of the best things going for this film. Will Ferrell as Harold Crick gives a believable, mature performance (quite a change from everything else he's done) and makes his mundane hero likable, especially in scenes with the adorable Maggie Gyllenhaal. Emma Thompson is fantastic as Karen Eiffel, the tortured and slightly crazy narrator, and Dustin Hoffman is appropriately eccentric as Harold's adviser in all things literary. Tony Hale (one of my favorites from Arrested Development) and Queen Latifah round out the strong supporting cast, which includes a cameo from the lovely Kristin Chenoweth. But despite its pleasing aesthetics and spot-on casting, "Stranger Than Fiction" suffers from a script that seems a little...empty. The potential for comedy, for touching scenes between other characters, and for more explanation of the "narration phenomenon" is diminished because the film chooses to focus entirely on Harold's journey. While it is made perfectly clear that Harold's personality is intended to be equivalent to that of a shoehorn, that very trait causes him to be incredibly uninteresting, and though Ferrell does what he can to make his character sympathetic, the result is an ambivalence that ruins the rest of the film. Without a real interest in the outcome, "Stranger Than Fiction" remains a nice-looking, slightly amusing and ultimately uneventful one hundred and eleven minutes.</comment>

    <title>Young Family Fun</title>
    <comment>Long time gamer, young family man. I have played every Mario Party of the series and this would be the easiest of the series to use and pick up without a lot of practice. My 3-year-old quickly understood the concept of waving the Wiimote 'up' to roll the die and there being a super basic board is highly beneficial to us. The smaller amount of items leads to more strategy than before, and the items appear to be better balanced to be useful on each of the different boards. Like all the Mario Party games, it's more fun in a group as a silly time-waster, which is good that this version comes with a 10-turn option. It should be noted that the lack of WiFi may be a bad thing when looking at the entire market today but once it is noted that this game is a local social phenomenon I appreciate the fact that they did not take away from the playability to give us online options. Online play will probably come with Mario Party 9... In conclusion, it's a strong graphics update to the franchise, yes I just used the Wii and graphics in the same review. From the Gamecube versions this offer is the prettiest ever, though for larger televisions I wish there was a way to remove the pesky border from both sides and use the entire screen when looking at the board.</comment>

    <title>For Discriminating Ears</title>
    <comment>I am very picky about the sound quality of my speakers. I compared these to several other speakers, including the Bose, and these provide a much richer sound. Even at higher volume the sound does not get distorted. I also like the fact that they are easy to carry with you because of the hand hold groove in the back. I recommended these to my parents, and they and their friends were amazed at how beautiful they sound. Don't think twice - buy them!</comment>

    <title>Witty Dark Comedy</title>
    <comment>Season 2 of Weeds is a brilliantly written and acted delight, picking up where last season left off with the same dark and witty humor. My only complaint is that it sometimes pushes the line of comedy into drama and the plotlines get to be a bit dramatic, but they have done a wonderful job with this season!</comment>

    <title>The Reason You Buy an XBox 360 and Live</title>
    <comment>I'd recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a great multiplayer experience as the online gaming you'll get out of this gamer is open ended. The story is quite compelling and exciting as well. This is definately worth the buy and is a game you'll be playing for quite sometme. Replay value Online= Extremely High</comment>

    <title>Much of the Same</title>
    <comment>I am a big Dashboard fan. I think that Chris' lyrics are beautiful and each listener can relate to the heartbreak in his songs. But, this new album sounds so much like all the other Dashboard Confessional albums, it was a little of a dissapointment. If you're not that familiar with DB, then I think you'll enjoy it. But for the fellow hardcore fans, I think it's a little too much of the same.</comment>

    <comment>This album is a great example of what Snow Patrol has to offer. The single "Chasing Cars" sets the tone of the whole album. The rest of the songs are just as great as the single, give them a try!</comment>

    <title>A Must Buy!</title>
    <comment>This is just a must buy if you own a 360 console. The multiplayer has improved with more options of games, more guns, more vehicles, and a great ranking system that will keep you entertained for hours. The campaign is shorter than Halo 2 but you will find yourself playing it again because coop is now an option. Its just pure fun, there is no reason not to get it.</comment>

    <title>Worthwhile Wait</title>
    <comment>There is so much more to this game than many people see on the surface. The 4-player co-op is great, and the multiplayer offers months of fun. You can easily spend an hour a night after playing just rewatching your games in the replay system and taking screenshots to send to your friends. Forge is another amazing contribution. If you don't like what Bungie did with a map, change it yourself. All in all easily worth $60</comment>

    <title>Beautiful Product</title>
    <comment>The new Apple keyboard is designed almost perfectly. Although it may take a little getting used to because of the different feel of typing on it. Easily the best keyboard that I have ever typed on. I highly recommend this to anyone, especially those with a Mac, as the special function keys work beautifully with operations such as iTunes song changing and volume changing.</comment>

    <title>Worth the Wait</title>
    <comment>The Spill Canvas has been blown me away one more time. While I do miss the acoustic days from Sunsets &amp; Car Crashes, they have matured alot and have kept and adapted the lyrical style that has made them popular. When I listen to their songs it sounds like something that a person would really be feeling or thinking. Even though some may complain their songs are too "emo" since it deals mostly with relationships and/or lost loves and stuff. . . Now onto my only con. While this is a step up from their last album, I feel as though some of these new tracks have been made into "radio friendly songs", and given a pop/rock beat. Now while I do admire them for wanting to expand the fan base and explore styles and make more money, I just hope they do not turn into other certain bands selling out to music television.</comment>

    <title>A+ picture and sound</title>
    <comment>I am a huge fan of the original Halloween and have purchased many different copies of this film over the years. The blu-ray edition is by far the best I have seen yet. The picture and sound quality are amazing for a film that was made almost 30 years ago. The color and resolution of the film make it look like it was filmed only recently.The only negative about the disc is that there are no new extra features that have not been released before on previous dvd editions. This is the best horror film ever and this is the best release yet.</comment>

    <title>Not Worth The Money</title>
    <comment>I love Guitar Hero, it's one of my favorite games. I mean, what's not to love about feeling like a famous Rocker in your own living room? I have to declare myself disapointed about Guitar Hero Rocks N 80s though... Not because the songs aren't fun, or the selection poor. It just feels to me like there is not enough new content for this to warrent being it's own game. There are no unlockables, and there aren't that many songs to begin with. I feel, with the way this game is designed, that it should have been marketed as an expansion set to the already existing GH2. I might pay $15-$20 for it. But I don't feel that the content is new or strong enough to stand as a game alone.</comment>

    <title>most anticipated game ever for a reason</title>
    <comment>This game is the best game I have ever played, I was a fan of halo 2 but it is not even in the same league as halo 3. One of my favorite parts of halo 3 is that there is no way to cheat!!! Everything in the game has been upgraded, and was the most highly anticipated video game release ever, and for good reason!</comment>

    <title>Extremely Entertaining Show</title>
    <comment>This show is amazing. Such a refreshing new concept and wonderfully directed. The only complaint is that the season probably could have been shortened to around 15 episodes and deleted a lot of the filler. Network TV tends to stretch out their storylines for a full 20+ episode season.</comment>

    <comment>This installment of the NFS series is definitely one of the best racing games out there. Being able to drive all around the city, getting chased by the police is fun in itself. The racing is amazing, with so many fun race types. Car customization is the best ever, everything from the color of your car to how wide your spoiler is. I highly recommend this game to any one who is looking for a great game to play.</comment>

    <comment>if you're looking for a good roll playing, open ended game, Two worlds is pretty good. i had very high hopes for it when i got it just because i was such a fan of Oblivion. graphics are great, but the dialogue is BRUTAL. infact its completely horrible. i don't know half the story line because it sounds SO BAD. it's really pathetic! besides the fighting...oblivion blows this game away. j/ keep playing oblivion and save yourself some money.</comment>

    <title>WATCH THIS MOVIE</title>
    <comment>I watched this movie 2 years ago and always wanted to buy it. When I actually bought I could believe I owned it because I have told my family about this movie before and now they can actually watch the movie and see it for theirself. It is at an amazing price and it is based on the book by Mitch Albom. You don't neccesarily have to read the book but you should if you want to learn more about the movie's story about meeting the five people. I cry every time I watch this movie and it never gets old. I guess this movie teaches you about life. I love this movie and reccomend to all my friends. If I were you I would purchase this movie beacause its a great movie to ad to your collection.</comment>

    <comment>This new game for the Guitar Hero series is amazing. All of the songs just make you want to turn up the volume and jam as if a live band was backing you up. If you own or know someone who owns a PS2 and loves true rock n roll, then you and everyone else would love this product.</comment>

    <comment>When you get the chance to co/op halo 3 with 3 buddies that are not even in the same city as you and who don't want to go until you beat the game on Legandary. You know you have a good game. Not only can you co/op but aslo multiplay for hours. There is just tons of stuff to do in this game and the graphics are amazing! I bought this game and have not been able to put it down since.</comment>

    <title>Serenity - Made for Browncoats : )</title>
    <comment>This collector's edition is a must have! If you are a fan of Firefly and loved the cast you will not be disappointed. If you've never seen either, you'll fall in love with the cast and story line. The bonus features are great and the outtakes are priceless. The series was great and I was so mad when it was cut...but they sure came back with a bang...HAHA!! It was nice to see others felt the same way about the cancellation and were willing to do something about it. The series did not get its chance to shine at all, but some of us realized it had something special. The Serenity movie is fabulous, especially wrapped up with the extras in the Collector's edition. I own the Firefly series, Serenity, and this edition. If you are looking for characters you can related to, humor, sarcasm, action &amp; adventure...oh, and a hot captain - THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU!!</comment>

    <title>Paper is good, but ink cartridges unreliable</title>
    <comment>They say if something is too good to be true, it probably isn't (true, that is). This item falls into that category. The 150 sheets of glossy paper, alone, are probably worth the purchase price. To get a full set of 6 ink cartridges with it, worth over $70, was an unbelievably good value - or so I thought. Not long after I inserted the magenta cartridge, I got an error message indicating I had inserted a used cartridge, even though I had taken it from a sealed package. It was out of ink in about 1/4 the normal time, requiring a quick return to the store buy another one. I had the same problem with a couple of the other cartridges as well. To be completely fair, I would again like to point out that the paper alone was probably worth the purchase price. The fact that ink cartridges were included at all is definitely a bonus, and at least 3 may have been full. This is great package if you just want to print a few pictures. But if, like me, you buy this package hoping to get a $70 set of ink cartridges at half price with glossy paper as a bonus, you may be disappointed. To avoid disappointment, make sure you have extra ink cartridges as a backup.</comment>

    <title>The Return of the King to TV</title>
    <comment>After its smashing success of the first season of SciFi's update on the classic Battlestar Galactica, season 2 brought with it a new view on social issues with a great drama. The SciFi scenery is just a great additional perk to this action packed half-season of this extraordinary show. More secrets about the cylons are revealed, as well as past secrets about Adama and Roslin come to light. The battle continues as the Galactica is joined by a new battlestar and internal conflicts rise upon the disagreements of the two battlestars. Nevertheless, the fight against the cylons is still more important to the survival of humanity and the ultimate goal; to reach planet earth. Enjoy the thrill, the drama, and the action of these episodes.</comment>

    <comment>Guitar Hero 2 is the best video game I've played in a while. It's so addicting. I could play it for hours. I once played it 4 hours straight, didn't go to bed until 4 am, and got up at 7 am to go to an amusment park. Best ever.</comment>

The campaign is so much fun, especially if your doing it with a friend and the new space battles are awesome. I highly recommend you get this game.</comment>

    <title>Never Mind</title>
    <comment>Punk rock, the way it should be. With lyrics ranging from subjects such as abortion, anarchy, and the antichrist, it's a wonder how some modern "punk bands" can truly identify their sound with that of these guys. There's truly nothing pop about this album. It's all hard rock mixed with metal mixed with chaos, thrown into a blender, and served up bleeding from the face. Featuring the Steve Jones (also guitarist), Glen Matlock, and the infamous Sid Vicious on bass (throughout various songs), John Lydon (more popularly known as Johnny Rotten) on vocals, and Paul Cook on drums, this classic album (there's a classic albums DVD availible too) from 1977 truly defined an era and changed the world of music for ever.</comment>

Fighting is awesome and sneaking around stealthily finishing off your target is a blast. Also the chariot races are loads of fun after you have played campaign for a while. This game is a must have.</comment>

    <title>Quite funny</title>
    <comment>A movie never tried before. It couldn't have been done better. When people hear about this movie, they instantly think it's just a goofy, funny movie. Well, it's not. "Knocked Up" is a movie that's not just funny, but get's serious sometimes. The director did a great job of making a serious issue funny and touching at the same time. This is a movie for just about anyone.</comment>

    <comment>This is an excellent movie! Reese Witherspoon was excellent even at the age of 14. This emotional movie is packed with love, jealousy, family, and strife. This movie will leave you smiling at times and crying at times. It leaves you remembering those first love/crush emotions everyone experiences while growing up.</comment>

    <comment>If you're looking for a super addicting, really fun game, this is the game for you! Nothing is more fun than rocking out like a rock star! It is also great for working on coordination. So don't discourage too quickly if you just can't get it down. It'll be worth it the more you catch on to it! Easily fills hours of boredom. :-)</comment>

    <title>Best DVD around</title>
    <comment>I have a huge affinity for this film, so I was very happy when this disc was put out. The transfer is of sterling quality; the black &amp; white picture is so crisp, and the restoration leaves little to be desired. Criterion has done it again, and not just from the standpoint of releasing a fine digital version of the film. The extras are exceptionally informative, particularly the interview with director Jules Dassin. This is exactly the kind of in-depth conversation I like to see with directors. All in all, a great disc has been provided for what is arguably the greatest film ever!</comment>

    <comment>The campaign mode is brilliant. And the additions of 4 player campaign, as well as online campaign mode make it much more interesting than the previous Halo game. The multiplayer is more intricate than ever, adding new features like the bubble shield and portable gun turrets. Overall, Halo 3 is a new experience that is definately worth buying.</comment>

    <title>Great case but strap scratches screen!</title>
    <comment>The Canon digital ELPH camera case and strap is a good and bad product. While it's pros' include: great protection, soft case interior, durable leather exterior, and stylish silver emblem on cover front, the con's almost negate these desirable qualities. The stylish silver emblem on the leather strap (a huge selling point) scratches and damages the screen when the leather case is not on!! I bought the digital ELPH camera brand new last year and bought the accessories to go with it (new memory card and awesome case with leather strap!). At first I loved everything, especially the new case with it's stylish strap but soon I took the case off, set the camera down, and somewhere in the mix the strap came in contact with the screen and permanently scratched the screen of my brand new camera! Buy this product but use caution when using the strap, which can damage the screen.</comment>

    <comment>This is the ending that halo deserved. The game is flawless in that it is fun,and very challenging. The multi-player is great and good for spending hours on, and the 4 player co-op is also a nice touch. Every weapon from all the games return, while the brutes are even harder to kill. Overall this game is worth every penny and more</comment>

    <comment>This show was one of the best shows of last season. The only reason it got cancelled was because it was too smart for the common person. All of Sorkin's TV shows are. People don't want to think anymore when they watch TV. They just want it to me a mindless experience. Its very sad that this show didn't get picked up for another season.</comment>

    <title>Fun and Addictive</title>
    <comment>This game is funny and fun to play. It's board game play is what pulled me and my friends in. The mini-games are challenging and there is a lot to unlock and find. This is a game for competitive people who love strategy games.</comment>

    <title>Fun until it broke</title>
    <comment>Fresh out of the box, it worked great. But about a year and a half later, it went completely out of calibration. It was fun while it lasted.</comment>

    <title>Nice Upgrade</title>
    <comment>This product provides Microsoft with a nice upgrade from the last Office 2003. Microsoft has had the same basic layout from at least Office 2000, just few changes between the two. Office 2007 has come with drastic changes. I put drastic changes as a con for those people who are not as computer literate as others and for those who take longer to learn to use new programs. Since this is drastically different it will take a little while to learning the new feature layouts. The programs themselves are great. There are more editing and appearence changes for fonts, charts and images. It is easier to make drawing 3-D, beveled, colored, shadowed or even to add visual effects. If an object is made then two new ribbons are created access editing options quicker. Instead of having the Menu bar as in the past they are replaced with ribbons allowing a more graphical user interface to make choosing easier. Word is more or less the same features as it always has as being a word processor. Excel provides chart options that are easy to find and visually see before choosing the one that fits your needs for the data. The formulas for equations are better organized. I find the biggest improvement comes with PowerPoint. The theme options have grown tremendously and you have the option to download more free themes from their website. Also to add animation and other effects provides a quicker new editing window. Other than the drastic appearance change, slowing some people down, Microsoft has done exceptional with their upgrade. They offer a various line of products to best suit your needs. There software comes with three licenses allowing it be installed on three personal computers legally.</comment>

    <comment>This game is good, it's just like GH2 but different songs. To me the new songs are good because playing the same ones over and over again can get pretty tiring. Buy this game if you are a fan of GH2.</comment>

    <title>Oustanding Game</title>
    <comment>This game is an amazing improvement over Halo 2, it brings back the true feel of the original Halo title while breathing new life into it with the beauty of HD and the simplified controller layout of the Xbox 360 system. The campaign is short but sweet, and there are literally hundreds of hours of entertaining multi-player content.</comment>

    <comment>This movie is so much fun to watch. Its fun because you can relate. The girls as kids have experiences that are either universal or can be related to something you experienced as a kid. And the friendships between the girls are unforgettable.</comment>

    <title>The great sound you expect from Bose</title>
    <comment>Bose Companion 5 Multimedia Speakers are a luxurious addition to any computer system used for listening to music, watching TV or movies. As expected, this speaker system delivers rich, exceptionally clear, Bose-quality sound. I use my speakers with a Dell laptop through a USB port and use Windows Media Player (WMP) as my primary music player. I save all of my personal CDs in high-quality WMP files and the results from the Bose speakers are crisp, clear, deep, rich sound. The volume/mute control pod is a great feature for adjusting the level for different music types, and the quick Mute allows for fast response when answering the phone. I keep the control pod right next to my phone which reduces fumbling when I receive a call. The USB input allows for clear, digital sound signals to be processed by your Bose speakers. This is particularly useful when your computer is not well shielded internally causing whirrring or whinig noises in your sound output. The passing of the digital signal eliminates these noises. Alternatively, you can plug your iPod or other MP3 player directly into the system through your control pod, using a stereo mini-plug. If you want the best sound from your computer system, this is the best computer-based system to purchase. Sometimes when booting up my computer the USB signal gets "stuck" which generates an annoying mid-level tone from the speakers. Once the Windows system is fulled booted, the problem automatically goes away. When Windows Vista was released, the Windows Control Panel functions for the speakers changed and Bose was very responsive to assisting me choose the correct settings for my speakers.</comment>

    <comment>This game is great, the interactive controls really make it fun and exciting. It takes a little while to learn how to fly the planes but once you figure it out it is so much fun. The levels are fun and never get old, dogfighting is a blast. A must have for all Wii owners.</comment>

    <title>Best Movie Ever</title>
    <comment>This movie is a great thiller movie. Its gets people at the edge of their seats. Many people may not like this because it is about a man with a sick sick mind. Also, this movie has great main characters and event thought at the beginning there is an event that could be startling to others sets the whole mood. If you enjoy movies with a little scary parts in them then this is the movie for you/</comment>

    <title>G.O.O.D. Music</title>
    <comment>Kanye's hard work is evident on Graduation. He came close to topping his classic College Dropout with this album and definitely outdid Late Registration. The production on the album is superb, with samples from Daft Punk, features from T-Pain, Lil Wayne, Mos Def. The only knock on this album is that his production value is so great, sometimes his lyrics can't keep up. Classic album! A must-buy!</comment>

    <title>RocketFish To The Rescue</title>
    <comment>I just moved to a new place and the layout of the room would not accommodate speaker wires running across the floor. My front speakers and center channel were not an issue as there was no foot traffic; however, the two rear speakers were an issue. I came across the Best Buy site and read reviews on the Rocketfish. The package came with very basic speaker wires. Luckily, I had enough of my own speaker wire and used it instead. The sender was hooked up with the speaker wires to the back of the amplifier. The AC adapter was plugged into an outlet. The receiver was hooked up to the two rear speakers with speaker wires. The plug was unraveled from the bottom of the unit and into the wall. The sender light would blink until the signal was received by the receiver. The light on the sender would then turn a steady red. The volume on the receiver is set to low initially and would need to be turned up. Overall, the sound quality is good. I agree that when I turned off the system, there was a hum coming from the rear speakers. I personally do see it as an issue to power off the units when not in use. I am happy with the performance of this product, especiall for the price.</comment>

    <title>Tough but fun</title>
    <comment>This game is a lot of fun if you learn how to keep your aim steady. It's so hard to keep the aimer facing straight because every time you move your wrist your guy spins around, and stares up into the sky. If your looking for a challenge though this is it, and i love a challenge so if your like me, you should buy this game.</comment>

    <title>excellent purchase</title>
    <comment>this speaker does exactly what the name suggests. It provides a spacious room filling sound that reflects off walls to surround the listener now a little bit about the sound. bass is relatively tight and fuller than one would expect at this price level. however, under HT applications, bass sometimes grew muddy and loose. this happened rarely and did not affect my overall listening experience. treble and midrange were extended without being too bright, overall nice and crisp. basically these are excellent speakers for the price range, but do not expect watt/puppy's nor 802's. do not listen to the Bose bashers, buy em'</comment>

    <title>Great Phone</title>
    <comment>Overall the Phone is a great Piece. Very clear even when Speaker phone is used. Chain Dial is a great feature I love. You dont have to enter pin# and phone # when calling cards are used. Feed all details and forget it. Share address book to all handsets is great feature. Can't use address book with Base :-( Alarm can't be set up to recur daily, which means you cant use it in place of alarm clock. If you want to use it that way, you need to set up alarm every day! Can't use Base for Alarm :-( Switch off ringer (Only Light up) is a great feature. But it cant be done at the press of a button! You need to go thru long Menu. Didn't see significant change in Voice Enhancer or Boost ! Slow talk is a great feature if any one wants to use.</comment>

    <title>Fantastic Four 2-Movie Collection</title>
    <comment>Wanted to buy "Fantastic 4 - Silver Surfer" and found this double box set which was a good price and convenient. I didn't own the first one so this was a good idea. F-4 Silver Surfer movie was well done, excellent special effects and the story line was good. I really enjoyed it with my Home Theatre system. Good color and sound. Highly recommended. Saw the first F-4 in the movies and watched it on my home theatre and enjoyed it. I read the comics as a kid and these actors do a great job with their respective parts. Very well done and enjoyble. Stan Lee rules - still.</comment>

    <title>lots of fun</title>
    <comment>I really like this game and a lot of my friends do too. It is challenging and keeps you hooked. I think the different operations are interesting as well. And once you get better you can do them on different difficulty levels. I am a nurse so I think it is fun to remove people's tumors and defribrilate etc. It's a good game to play, but it is only 1 player so when I'm playing with friends it gets a little boring to have to wait your turn. I would definitely recommend this game to others. Kids may have some difficulty with it though with maneuvering the controls. This game uses the nunchuck controller.</comment>

    <title>Surprisingly Awesome</title>
    <comment>I went to go see this movie on a rainy day when I had nothing else to do. I wasn't expecting much, but man, this movie really surprised me. I'm 17, and I don't often laugh at jokes in an animated movie.... but this one was different. The dialog seemed much more realistic than other movies, and I felt more connected to what the characters were saying. The documentary style makes everything ten times better. It reminded me of The Office and it's deadpan humor. The animation in this movie is spectacular, and the environments are very colorful and memorable. I loved the soundtrack to this movie as well (Sugar Ray's "Into Yesterday" is very relaxing). In my opinion, everything in this movie just fell into place perfectly, and my only complaint is that it's too short. But that's okay. The other great thing about this movie is that it's not age specific. Anyone from kids to adults will enjoy it. And it is NOT another penguin movie. It's a surfing movie. The only time that it seems like a penguin movie is in the beginning in Cody's home town of Shiverpool. But then again, I thought that was one of the funniest parts of the movie. What I'm trying to say is, go out and buy the DVD, I'm almost certain you'll enjoy it. It's a nice, relaxing, feel-good movie to watch with your family.</comment>

    <title>Complete Music Sound Collection</title>
    <comment>My son gave this cd to me for a Christmas present. I put the cd in my car on the way to Las Vegas and I just sat back and enjoyed the ride. The trip went by real fast. The music brought me back to the time when I use to run home from school just to watch Dark Shadows. The cd was just how I remembered the songs. I have even started collecting the Dark Shadows movies all over again to rewatch. I have my daughter watching the series all over again also.</comment>

    <title>Pretty Good, But not Deserving of a 5 star</title>
    <comment>Finally the big game- Halo 3 has been released. While it is a huge Blockbuster hit (pre-ordered by over 1 million people); it does meet its users expectations. The obvious strengths about Halo 3 is the online multiplayer content; if you have an xbox live then halo 3 is a perfect buy. The sound and graphics mesh nicely and the atmosphere of the game comes out as a true FPS. Its shortcommings are the very obvious 1 player campaign mode that takes about 5 hours to go through(Which is way too short) and the repitive hit and kill gameplay. Summary- Halo 3 is a good game in multiplayer, but they still need to work on the single player aspects and the repetitiveness.</comment>

    <title>Emmy Winning Show, DVD Needs Work</title>
    <comment>This is a review of the DVD release and not the show. The show itself is perfect. Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin fit so well into this show that it feels like you're watching a documentary on The Girlie Show and not a sitcom. Funny documentary, not snore documentary. It's obvious why 30 Rock won the Emmy on its first year out. Having said that, the DVD release isn't quite up to par for a show of this quality. On the plus side, the picture and sound quality are first rate. The picture is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen just as it is broadcast. Sound is selectable between Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0, English only. Subtitles are available in English and Spanish. The episodes are split among three discs. Unfortunately, each episode is a whole chapter on the disc. Many other TV shows on DVD will at least split episodes into chapters at their original commercial breaks. If you skip ahead to a new chapter on 30 Rock, you're moving ahead to a new episode, not to a point later in the same episode. I don't know if that's a major factor to other TV series viewers, but it's a sticking point with me. The bonus features are all on the third disc. There are 5 episodes with commentaries, but the episodes are all repeated on the third disc just for the commentary. This is very unusual. Instead of making the commentaries a separate selectable audio track on the episodes where they appear, they've duplicated the episodes there on the third disc with the commentary being the only audio track. The show audio is lowered in the background on the commentaries. Most of the commentaries consist of only one person, which makes for a lot of gaps. When there aren't multiple people on a commentary track, it can be dull just listening to one person say things like "this is actor x, he's really funny". Other bonus features include: deleted scenes from several episodes; "The Wrap Party" which is basically a gag reel but with a horrible voiceover; "An Evening with Kenneth" in which Kenneth the page does his own mini talk shows with cast of The Girlie Show; "Behind the Scenes" in which Judah Friedlander, Jack McBrayer and Lonny Ross show us around the sets and talk to cast and crew of 30 Rock; and "Makin' It Happen" which are three webisodes of the show Will Arnett's character created from the episode "Fireworks". The packaging is typical cardboard with glossy graphics on the outside. The graphics actually wrap around to the inside of the outer packaging. Overall, this is a DVD set worth owning. The show is worthy of multiple viewings. I mentioned are minimal considering the quality of the show itself.</comment>

    <title>Get off the</title>
    <comment>Disappointed with "The Matrix Reloaded"? Felt let down? ACHIEVE "Equlibrium" by watching this movie. First of all, this is another much needed and sorely missed breath of fresh air that we've seen so rarely come down the pike from the cookie-cutter that is Hollywood. This movie made me feel the same way after viewing such films as "Boondock Saints", "The 1st Matrix", "Smoking Aces", "Memento", "Donnie Darko", "Brotherhood of the Wolf", as well as The films of Paul Thomas Anderson, Takeshi Kitano, Guy Ritchie, and Takashi Miike--which is completly surprised, and pleased with the blend of intelligence with action and an ever increasing difficulty level of taking elements of genres and giving them a unique new twist (true originality is all but dead). Granted this movie uses elements of stories we've seen before whether it be the oppressive dystopias of movies like 1984, Fahrenheit 451, A Brave New World, THX 1138, Metropolis, Brazil, Gattaca, Logan's Run, Rollerball (the original), or "The Handmaid's Tale". It's interesting to note that Libria's citizens are encouraged to "rat" each other out. It brings to mind Mao or McCarthy although not to such hysterical fever pitches...that would be a "sense offense". Instead of books, or political idealogies, emotions themselves are outlawed. Instead of "A Brave New World's" ~soma~ the good citizen's of Libria have the opiate for the masses "Prozium". This is Libria's cure to end war (unlike Rollerball's "game"). Not that ALL emotions are eradicated , as director Kurt Wimmer shares, rather prozium eliminates mankind's tempestous highs and lows. And those emotions, ambition, jealousy, that might further Libria's cause of promoting "Non-feeling" are allowed such as Taye Diggs character's motivation to bring John Preston (Christian Bale) down. It's also interesting to note that the director meant this as a parable, a cautionary tale of socio-politcal ideology gone wrong, rather than a literal story. The Grammaton Clerics similarity to the sandmen in "Logan's Run" ("Minority Report" has similarities to "LR" as well) was interesting--two partner cops hunting down "offenders" whether they be "runners", "Pre-criminals", or in this case "sense offenders". One has to pursue and kill a partner then have his conscience / soul pricked to have an epiphany and find they are questioned or pursued themselves. I can't say enough about the performances other than agreeing with the director he batted a thousand with his casting. Everybody was superb, Christian Bale is a delight to watch grow with each new performance (it took Hollywood long enough to wise up to this proven action star with acting chops to boot-- like the late Brandon Lee, Christian Bale packs a deadly combo of ripped physicallity with a deep emotional wellspring to draw on). Sean Bean continues to blow me away with performances of his "flawed= REAL" characters, whether in "Goldeneye", "Patriot Games", "Ronin", or "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" Bean wrenches a very soulful, human performance out of what little screen time he's given. The action of this movie is a much needed shot in the arm for HARD CORE ACTION JUNKIES. The impressive "Gun Kata" invented by the director is a fresh, inventive next-step in the evolution of the cinematic gun battle. Hong Kong innovators such as John Woo / Chow Yun Fat ushered in the Balletic "Gun Fu" (as coined by writer Ric Meyers). This film unlike "The Matrix" and it's sequels does not rely on "wire-fu" stunts-- (the flip by Cleric Preston was accomplished by a diving champion stunt double) --refreshing after being bombarded by the likes of "D.O.A.", the 2 "Charlie's Angels" entries, augmentation of Jackie Chan (The Tuxedo), Jet Li (Pick one), and Chow Yun Fat (Bullet-proof Monk) movies. Don't get me wrong wire work is a great tool in use of projects involving super-human ability (such as Jet Li's multiverse titan in "The One") any number of recent Superhero movies, or the Swordplay classic "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". The action sequences resonate with the speed and beauty of the best of Jet Li's Hong Kong work, married with the swordplay scenes with Preston's use of the "Zatoichi" underhand swordhold style. The opening introduction to the prowess of the Grammaton Cleric's "Gun-Kata", the numerous confrontations between Preston and the many "sweepers", the Kendo bokken match between Preston and Brandt, and the climactic Hallway "weeble wobble-clip" gun battle, Preston and Brandt's "Face-off", and the final confrontation between Dupont (Angus MacFadyen / Braveheart) which innovatively uses the hand locking styles reminiscent of Wing Chun's 'chi sau'/'lok sau', or Tai Chi Chuan's 'toi sau' only with guns! I find "Matrix" comparisons rather tedious. As for Preston's clothes copying Neo, other than they are sleek tight fitting and black I don't see the comparison (I mean Neo was wearing a trenchcoat!) I also remind all that "Equilibrium" predates "Matrix re-loaded" in which the tables are turned Neo's "uber-mensch/superman" persona has on the "GOD Smock". I find that on occasion that 2 or more creative people will come up with the same idea independently from one another. So I agree with director Kurt Wimmer that the bros. Wachowski were giving Neo religious garb to outwardly represent his 'deity' which coincidently took on the 19th century deacon smock motif. In conclusion I find this to be a very enjoyable, overlooked movie that you should definitely check out. Thanks for reading, and thanks to Best Buy for this forum.</comment>

    <title>Fun, but disappointing</title>
    <comment>This game was a little disappointing when compared to Guitar Hero I and II because it just doesn't have as many songs or things to buy at the "store" It is also really easy to beat. The songs are great though which makes it worth purchasing. BUT if you already have a friend with the game, play theirs and save the money!</comment>

    <title>One of the best music DVD's I've seen!</title>
    <comment>This is one of the best DVD's that a band has released that I've ever seen. On top of the fact that Lamb of God plays incredibly well live - you get to watch what they're like off the stage as well. The documentary follows the guys as they tour for their album "Ashes of the Wake" (check out my review for that album as well!) and the concert footage is all taken from a show at the Trocadero Theatre in Philadelphia (thus the title of the DVD/CD.) Without ruining it for anyone who hasn't seen this, this DVD shows you a very real look at what it's like to be on tour for a long time, with the same people on a bus. Be ready to see some footage that not very many bands would allow to be released on their movie. It's great!</comment>

    <title>THE GREATEST GAME EVER!!!</title>
    <comment>This game will go down in history! No matter what you read on other reviews the numbers do not lie. This game broke the all time entertainment sales record for one day ($170 mill +) and a one week total of over $300 mill. The masses do not lie! The campaign is a little short but makes up for it in challenge and story. Where this game's strength is in the online game play. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes a good first person shooter and like a challenge! This is my all time favorite game and I have played a lot of games starting in 1979. I expect a game in the future will dethrone Halo 3, but for now this one reigns supreme!</comment>

    <title>Essential Shaw Brothers Classic</title>
    <comment>This was once released at "Master Killer". The Dragon Dynasty Series has the potential to provide excellent "old school" martial arts films that will thrill both new viewers and hardcore fans. This is an excellent copy of this classic. "The 36th Chamber of Shaolin" is a classic Shaw Brothers feature starring the incomparable Gordon Liu as a student who's morals run him head first into the Imperialistic Manchurian Dynasty. His family and friends are slaughtered by the oppressive government. Fleeting for his life, he seeks his revenge by learning the martial arts secrets of Shaolin Temple. However, Shaolin is a peaceful Buddhist temple and is not a sanctuary for hiding political criminals, and he is forced to use trickery in order to enter the temple. Once inside his training begins, but training is often not what it appears to be on the surface. Each grueling mundane task within the temple has be regimented in order to strengthen the body, teach balance and control, and, in the end, to become a master of kung fu. And, of course, he returns to lay down some serious kung fu justice upon his oppressors and manages to avenge this friends and family. This is a "not to be missed" classic directed by Liu Chia-liang ("Legendary Weapons of China" - Celestial Pictures/Image Entertainment release) and guest starring Lo Lieh ("Five Fingers of Death" [aka "King Boxer" - also a Dragon Dynasty release]). Get it while you can. Don't let your chance to get this movie slip through your fingers. I haven't seen it available for close to 20 years. It is just as awesome now as it was then.</comment>

    <title>An informative release</title>
    <comment>Set This World Ablaze has an incredibly detailed history of the band as a documentary, along with some hidden easter eggs about the greatest band in the entire universe "Mr. Robotron" There is also a 70 minute concert (which was mixed and mastered by Adam Dutkiewicz - guitar for KsE) as well as music videos. There is certainly a lot of video on this one disk, and at this price it's a must have for even casual fans of the band. The documentary (featuring members of Lamb of God, God Forbid, All That Remains, Shadows Fall, and more!) is funny, entertaining, and enlightening. The concert sounds amazing, and the guys have a lot of fun with it (as does the crowd, who knows they're being recorded!) The music videos are extras, and it never hurts to have them on a disk somewhere. In any case, if you're looking at this, you're somewhat interested in KsE, so go pick this up!</comment>

    <title>It's a Proven Series</title>
    <comment>At first sight, the game looks a lot like the 07 version but after playing a couple times you can see it's improved. Gang tackling adds realism and the graphics look slightly improved. There are a lot of fumbles and that makes it somewhat unrealistic. Overall the game is good but I'd wait till the price drops.</comment>

    <title>A Delightful Pixar Title!</title>
    <comment>I remember seeing the teaser trailer for Ratatouille back in 2006 and thinking that it looked, well, a little strange. However, I knew it was a Pixar movie, so no matter how strange it looked at the time it would certainly come through upon release. As it turns out, I was right. Ratatouille is simpler than some of Pixar's past releases and isn't quite as grandiose, but it doesn't have to be. It's just an hour and fifty minutes full of fun and delight with a dash of humor mixed in. The story is well-written, the characters are well-developed, and the animation shines as always. Pixar has come through again. Go see this movie - you won't be disappointed!</comment>

    <title>Halo 3 rocks</title>
    <comment>This game is truly amazing. I played Gears of War and thought there was no way Halo 3 could match that game. I was very wrong. Halo3 matched it and exceeded it. The game play is incredible and easy to get used to. There are a lot of buttons of the controller and using them all effectively is one of Halo's strong points. The graphics are 100 times better than Halo 2. I have yet to play online, but I have played other people by linking a few 360's together and that game play is incredible. All and all this game is wonderful and everyone should play it.</comment>

    <comment>I did have fun with this game. It's a good tide me over from GH2 to GH3, though many songs just aren't as much fun to play and you end up getting sick of 80s songs. I only got it because it was $40 bucks, and I got a $15 gift card. Do not pay 50 bucks for this game...it is not worth it, just buy GH3, or rockband- that looks pretty sweet</comment>

    <comment>For under $13, you won't find much better. It fits very naturally and sounds great. I did have to turn up the sound on my PSP but it has great range. A good buy as they don't move once in place and don't draw to much attention.</comment>

    <title>Mark Knopfler continued....</title>
    <comment>Another great album from one of the last american balaladeer from the 20th century. As mush as I love the artist however, and I have followed him since the early years of Dire Straits, I have to say that the album sounds just like the previous one. True Love and Punish the Monkey give a little more beat to the album but nothing stirring here unfortunately. In the Sky is my favourite song and exemplifies the idea of a true celestial ballad. This album sounds like a reflection of an aging soul who has done too much roadrunning...</comment>

    <title>I love this game!</title>
    <comment>Bungie did a tremendous job bringing Halo to it's conclusion. The story is fantastic, albeit a bit short. As for the gameplay, they stuck with the tried and true Halo formula, adding in a few minor tweaks for some amazingly entertaining gaming. The campaign is great, and the multiplayer offers so many options and incredible moments that it will never get old. If you own a 360, this game is a must have!</comment>

    <title>Emery Continues to Rock</title>
    <comment>I own the CD/DVD and it is well worth it. The DVD features two concerts of Emery, one acoustic and one regular. It also has behind the scenes features which are funny to watch and informative. The CD is great with outstanding tracks such as "The Party Song" and "Don't Bore Us Get to The Chorus." For some it may not be the usual Emery but this CD is great none the less. A few listens will change ones mind. For people not into Emery, it is a great place to start to listen. The acoustic tracks are an excellent bonus giving you a lighter more personal side to the band. Very outstanding and well worth owning.</comment>

    <title>Not too sure about this one!!!</title>
    <comment>I bought this movie the day it was released, and watched at home that same day. I was not very impressed with this movie. Would recommend people to rent not buy Deathproof. Huge fan of Tarantino films, "Pulp Fiction," "Jackie Brown," "Kill Bill 1 &amp; 2," and "From Dusk Til Dawn." Just not very impressed with this moive. The girls conversations seemed to resemble those of Jewels and Vincents in "Pulp Fiction," but these girls were not as comical or good. The Planet of Terror movie looks like "a dog in a pony show."</comment>

    <title>Best Ink Change Ever</title>
    <comment>Hewlett Packard is an excellent brand and printer ink #21 will install flawlessly &amp; effortlessly enabling you to be up and printing again in seconds. BestBuy also has the most consistent level of this item in stock at very competitive prices. When my printer needs reloading of ink, I cannot think of a more confident feeling, then purchasing HP #21 Ink at Bestbuy. A win-win scenario everytime!!</comment>

    <title>Can't be beat in this price range!</title>
    <comment>When looking for a quality lense for a name brand camera, as a hobby photographer, everything usually breaks down into two groups: Lenses intended for professional or career photographers that cost more than you are willing to pay. Specialty lenses that have a more limited use but fit your budget. This Canon lense is unusual in that it is very comfortably priced (by comparison anyway) and is very versatile. Fully compressed, the 70mm length is good for portrait, nature photography and architecture shots. Extended to it's maximum length, the 300mm telephoto is very good for sports and wildlife shots. The maximum aperture of F4-5.6 is exceptional in this price range and will allow good shots in reasonably low light even without a tripod. When used with your Canon dSLR, the lense retains all the electronic focus and aperture control you want. This lense and a small wide-angle zoom are really the only lenses you could need for general hobby photography. So you can keep your gear bag compact as well. The attached example picture was taken in early morning light shortly after sunrise at the full 300mm length. No retouching has been done to it yet.</comment>

    <comment>While nothing particularly innovative game of Halo 3, it still supplies solid game play. The weapons are better balanced from halo 2, and the addition of new weapons and items create a better multiplayer experience. The campaign, while shorter than desired, is rich in story and character development. Much is revealed in this final installation of the trilogy and the story is wrapped in quite well.</comment>

    <comment>This game looked to be a Great New replacement for those who play Oblivion.. The combining of objects seemed cool at first, but its to compinsate for the lack of content.. Dungons are weak, and small.. Story line is ok.. Money better spent on other games..</comment>

    <title>Big power in little box</title>
    <comment>This amp is very impressive, while peaking at 850+ watts at 2ohms it manages 600 watts rms at 2 ohms, thats were infinity exceeds beyond the rest in that it can deliver such a high rms wattage so that your subs or speakers are always playing at levels that they were made for. I let best buy install this amp along with 2 12inch infintys mounted into a bandpass box into a 07 mazda3 hatch and I get more thump then I need with this thing at 1/4 power, this amp also comes with a really cool remote that can be installed up front by the drive to adjust sub levels so that no matter what type of music you are listening to you can crank the bass with out having to turn up the music. And I promise this amp will make your subs hit hard.</comment>

    <comment>Lost is so great: season 2 is evidence of this. The DVD also has many great features like outtakes and the world of Sawyer and his nicknames. Great for any fan of Lost--and if you're not a fan of lost yet, grab seasons 1 and 2 and sit tight until season 3 comes out in December!</comment>

    <title>Fun Title in Spurts</title>
    <comment>Monkey Ball games have always been fun to play if you have multiple players involved. The single player feature has never really "floated my boat" so to speak. Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz is no different. Many of the mini games are so fun!!!! However, I'd say more than half of them are awkward and down right annoying to play. Hurling a shotput or trying to throw rings over little poles is a blast. Playing rock/paper/scissors or sumo wrestling is horrible...at best. Still, if you have four players in the room, there's bound to be someone that likes each game that's chosen. Overall, the game is very fun. Simply avoid those mini games that drive you stark driving mad.</comment>

    <comment>This movie is a pretty good movie for a thriller. The movie had a good storyline and good acting. Samuel L. Jackson did not really have a big rolel in this movie, and John Crusack did a good job playing his role. I never really felt drawn into the movie like I would like to. The beginning is pretty drawn out but it does set you up for what is going to happen. If you are expecting this to be a scary horror movie (like I did), it's not. I found this movie a little comical at times also. It is basically just a thinking movie. I would recommend you to rent this first before buying it. I hope that helped some kind a way.</comment>

    <title>Great Value</title>
    <comment>I needed a new Memory Stick Pro Duo for my PSP. The 1GB Pro Duo I had was getting a little too small and was not capable of letting me fully enjoy my PSP. Now the 4GB is a whole new story. The extra 3GB gives me more room to enjoy my movies, pictures and MP3s. Plus 4GB is more than enough space to store as many gamesaves as there are games currently out on the market. Also if you are not planning on using this Memory Stick Pro Duo for the PSP, its great for cameras too. It lets you store about 1135 seven megapixel images, which basically means that it can store more pictures than the camera's battery life will ever hold out for. It can also record about 50 minutes of 'fine' quality video. All my comparison on camera are done by a Sony Cybershot DSC-W55. Also the memory stick adapter that comes in the package also makes it easy to use as a replacement for any Sony devices that support its older counterpart the Memory Stick Pro format. Overall I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a new Memory Stick.</comment>

    <comment>The game is as good as the previous two. There are some new weapons and of course, a new storyline. It seems that the game was put together more for the massive audience that awaited it to play online. If you're looking to play the game solely for the story and to say that you've beat it, you are probably better off with Gears of War. If you played Halo2 online and got a chance to kick some butt, then you know that you can't own this game without logging on and trying out Halo 3!</comment>

    <title>Great Basic Case Made for the BlackBerry</title>
    <comment>This case is designed for the BlackBerry, and it fits perfectly. The slim clip design wears easily, even on women's business clothes. The phone is protected well, with the exception of the corners. When you slide the phone into the case and close the flap, the screen is turned off automatically and buttons cannot be pressed accidentally. This is the best case I've had for any phone. I use it when I have to travel with my phone; at home, I use a skin.</comment>

    <title>Not at all what I was expecting...</title>
    <comment>Firstly, know that this was written by a Siouxsie fan of almost 25 years (since Haeyena in 1984). I have every banshee album (including the Box-set) except one...The Rapture...and every creature album except Hai!...because after Seven Year Itch, I wasn't confident about hearing Siouxsie's singing again any time soon. But, I did finally purchase The Siouxsie Dreamshow, when it finally had a domestic release in the States, and was rather impressed by her much improved vocals...the surgeries must've really helped. So, with that in mind, I was rather confident about how her first solo album would sound and starving to purchase it the moment it was available. This is where things go "Gothically" wrong: 1) I hate the packaging of this album! One photo of Siouxsie, and it's not even the best of the ones taken for the album...and what's up with her face upside down?! Is this supposed to be "Downside Up -- Revisited"? I can't stand fold out lyrics and sleeve notes; they're so perishable and some of the lyrics can't be deciphered due to the cracks and creases. Her photos for her singles are WAY better and definitely more evocative of the Siouxsie mileu. What is this cover supposed to signify? It's the busiest and the most annoying of any cover I've seen from the world of Siouxsie. 2) What's up w/ the title of this album? What's the significance? The Creatures' Boomerang makes more sense than this. The title doesn't help describe or give theme to the overall work. 3) Some reviewer compared this album as being close in tone and feel to the banshees' Superstition? How so? Not really! It's closest to The Creatures' Anima Animus, which was my least favorite album by them. The problem w/ an artist like Siouxsie embarking on a solo career after fronting two bands is that there is such a wealth of quality, groundbreaking, classic material in her past that her future will be judged and predicated by it. There is not one song on this album that ties or --definitely not -- surpasses a Christine, a Night Shift, a Jigsaw Feeling, a Placebo Effect, a Dear Prudence, a Swimming Horses, a Happy House, or a Spellbound; not a But Not Them, a Miss The Girl, a Pluto Drive, a Say, or a Another Planet. Also, because she has been making great music for almost 30 years, this new stuff pales because some of it echoes what we've already heard before: If you're a banshees fan, Loveless (w/out question, the best song of the album...this should've been the first single, not the so-so Into A Swan), One Mile Below, Drone Zone, and Sea of Tranquility are for you. The other tracks, for the most part, sound Creatures-like, and or amalgams of both Creatures and banshees. They Follow You has a surprisingly Blondie-esque sound to it w/ its zany keyboards a la Jimmy Destri. But, honestly, the banshees last recorded track, Dizzy is way better than anything on this album. 4) The Voice: Siouxsie on this album, for the most part, does not evoke fond memories of her heights from her Dreamshow...people, this is closer to Seven Year Itch quality than Dreamshow...are you getting me, now? On some songs you say, "Yeah, sing it that way for the rest of the song (or album)!" Then, she falters back into that now-too-familiar atonal monotone, which does her very little good to enhance the music. Her voice is not pretty or powerful on many of these songs. 5) The Words: the lyrics aren't very deep, profound, or memorable, and they're short on being imagistic...that coming from Siouxsie is not good! Some people fear the gothic side of her is underplayed on this album...it's not so much that, it's just that the subject matter isn't that powerful, or clear, or engaging. The themes of this album: Something's happening to me...I'm changing; Uh-oh, something's about to happen; it's happened; this is not love anymore; what doesn't kill you makes you stronger; how low can I go?; the suburban life is like being on a sleeping pill; I am a body left at a crime scene by the seashore, and all of the evidence is being washed away (which sounds like a sequel to Steven Severin's beautiful, though sad Sea of Light, which is way better than this new song); and love at first sight is unreliable. That's it, folks! I found myself wishing for Severin's poetic lyrics to make an appearance, or even Budgie's occasional, interesting words. 6) The Music: What in many ways is most disappointing for me is the lack of variety and diveristy of music and musicians for this album...Siouxsie herself projected this album to sound a lot like the Dreamshow...I was expecting songs w/ a full orchestra, lush arrangements, decidedly pronounced brass sections, songs that sound intimate w/ only a few bandmates, then songs w/ multitudes of instruments (there are no Fireworks, Wheels On Fire, Slowdives, Overgrounds, or Killing Jars on this album)...I was looking for an album with the kind of exoticism of Kaleidoscope. Far from it was this album. For one, many of the core group of musicians are the same. I was expecting multiple drummers, guitarists, and bassists to appear on different tracks, not the same ones! Where the heck was Knox Chandler?! Robert Smith?! Members of The Clash?, Clem Burke from Blondie (he really could've added power to Siouxsie's kind of realm)?! And lastly BUDGIE!!! I know that their divorce killed that prospect probably, but God, he's been her only rhythm section since 1979, and the absence of him weakens the album and leaves a lot to be desired. And, in terms of enhancing her low vocals, WHERE IN THE WORLD WERE THE ELLIS TWINS?!?!?! WHY DIDN'T SHE GIVE THEM A CALL?! She was on record as stating that she had "a lot of collaborators in mind..." she wanted to work with...I assumed that meant she'd be working with a diversity of producers, writers, arrangers, etc. ALSO this album only contains TEN SONGS!!! After the longest break and gestation period she's had from making music, all she could come up w/ was a 41 minute CD, shorter than Anima Animus!!! I was looking for a number closer to 20 than 10!!! I thought the freedom and newness of the situation would have led to lots of creativity and ideas, not just enough for an album in 1977. The small number of songs puts even more importance on the quality and variety of them, which really makes the output precarious if not handled correctly. 7) The Future: I hope this album does well for Siouxsie, but I think this may be my last ride with the Queen of Goth. Listening to this album only drove me to put on her old albums, returning to the Siouxsie that I love and know. I guess I will have to live in the glory of her great past with all the new remasters that will be coming out over the years, which really has been moving at a snake's pace. Hopefully that should be enough. If you're new to Siouxsie, start from the beginning up to 1991, cause that's where the classics and the classic Siouxsie live. Siouxsie Fan: 1984-2007</comment>

    <title>Best DBZ season</title>
    <comment>This is my favorite season of Dragonball Z because it is non-stop action. The battle on planet Namek continues in this season, the entire season focused around the fight against Frieza. It doesn't get any better than this. All of the episodes look clearer and crisper than ever thanks to the DVD transfer. As with the other seasons of Dragonball Z already on the market, the episodes come commercial free with the original japanese theme songs. Personally I prefer the American guitar rendition so hopefully Funimation will at least include the American theme song in their special features the next season they put out.</comment>

    <comment>A must see for any hockey fan! I love that this movie is more realistic than most other hockey movies that i have seen. And even at over 2 hours in length this movie doesnt seem to drag on like many sports movies. I highly recommend!</comment>

    <title>Good Kid's Game</title>
    <comment>Mario Party 8 is a great game for kids. Several kids have played mine and love to play it together. The mini-games are fun and allow the kids to play against each other. However, most of the time it ends up choosing the same games and it can get old. It is great if you want a four-player game, but it is kind of slow for adults. Also, the game has poor graphics.</comment>

    <title>Solid Party Game</title>
    <comment>It had me at the first hit of the dice block. I had awesome fun the first few times i played it. But soon, after unlocking almost all minigames, it got a good bit less fun. Although, playing multiplayer is still great fun, it can still get pretty repetitive. Another thing, is that, really in most of the boards, winning is based nothing on ability to play the game. Bonus stars are given for using the most candy, landing on red spaces, and so forth. That is really a terrible idea; it can, a lot of times, cause a good gamer to loose because he didn't use candy to win. But all in all, it is what the title says, Mario PARTY 8. With a solid multiplayer, and some good minigames, and the innovation of the wii mote, i would recommend this to a friend.</comment>

    <comment>Excellent FPS, so far the Best Halo game. The Muti-player online is the best feature in this game, being able to have up to 4 players at one time doing the missions is great. The Achievements are great, about time MS got this part right with a nice mixture of solo play and mutiplayer. Some nice bonus as well, collecting all skulls lets you wear Samurai suit, completing the game on certain modes let you wear other armors. Only beef is same with most FPS is that the game is short in some sense but overall the Graphics and the story make up for it , as the story is very rich and it is one of the few games where you'll watch all the cut-scenes.</comment>

    <title>"Wow. Simply wow!"</title>
    <comment>One of the great technical and visual feats of our time. Superb direction from the great Alfonso Cuaron with the same superb performances that we have come to expect from Julianne Moore and Micheal Caine. The standout performance, though, has to be Clive Owen. His character goes through such an emotional arch and he conveys that arch so seamlessly throughout the whole film. His wonderfully gritty performance, Cuaron's flowing direction, and the realistically choreographed scenes made this seem like a mocumentary throughout most of the film. In fact, I sat there in the theatre and caught myself thinking that I was watching a documentary on the future. Together with the Matrix, this is one of the best sci-fi films I have ever seen.</comment>

    <title>An album everyone should hear</title>
    <comment>"Many times in life we only realize the importance of something once we have experienced its loss. And to think ahead to this possible loss helps us to truly appreciate the simplicity of someone being there. This helps us to know that the time we are given is not being taken for granted." -D. Bosche These are the words quoted at the end of the liner notes, and the concept for the entire album. Musically, Zao is one of the more intense and unique hardcore/metal bands you'll hear, but this album means alot more to me than just the music. For me, the lyrics are what really make this album brilliant because they offer a lot to think about. If you're into hardcore/metal, this album is worth listening to. If you're not into the genre(s), buy it anyways and just read the lyrics over and over again.</comment>

    <comment>While I was watching this movie i found myself laughing a ton. It was very funny and the acting was great. The movie flowed very well but the only flaw was all the drug use. I felt that there was too much use of drugs and it would of made the movie a little better if they would of cut it down a bit. All-in-all it was a good movie and I would recommend it too almost anyone. If you have a chance watch it</comment>

    <title>Good if you like Goofy</title>
    <comment>Seth Rogen does his loveable goofball character from '40 Year Old Virgin' again in this light comedy. He and his roommates don't look to be early 20s as the movie suggests, but they provide a dopey, funny backdrop for the 2 hours you spend watching. The plot is predictable and trite, but that's not why you'd buy this movie anyway. Laughed more watching the deleted scenes, gag reals, etc. than the actual movie, but liked the movie enough to actually WATCH the extras (pretty unusual for me).</comment>

    <title>Good, but not great</title>
    <comment>Family Guy's fifth season was a strange experience. Instant classics would alternate with droll, paint-by-the-numbers yawners. This set is a must-buy on the strength of episodes like "PTV", "Brian Goes Back to College", and "The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz". But mindnumbingly awful episodes like "Patriot Games" and "Petergeist" drag the collection down to the realm of merely 'good'. Hardcore fans will be excited at the inclusion of commentary tracks for just about every episode on the disc, but the recordings lack the obvious chemistry of the pre-cancellation writing staff.</comment>

    <title>Great purchase</title>
    <comment>I've had these speakers for about 8 months now and they seem to be a great purchase. They let my music sounds spacious while still sounding direct to my ears. These speakers can take quite a beating as well, sometimes I turn my Yamaha sound receiver up to +10dB (110 watts RMS per channel) when jamming out when nobody else is home and I can't even hear myself scream. The best part about it is there's no distortion introduced either. A big plus! I would deffinately recommend these speakers.</comment>

    <title>It is what it is.</title>
    <comment>There's nothing wrong with this antenna. I live in the city and I get most channels, but the reception is quite poor. RCA sells plenty of higher-end models with stronger strength, so I can't slight the product for not working for me when I probably should have gotten one of the more expensive ones. One thing I can comment on is the short cable. If it were longer, I could move the antenna around to find better reception spots.</comment>

    <title>Best of the Halo series</title>
    <comment>This is quite a step up from Halo 2. New features such as The Forge, which allows modifications of multiplayer maps, to the Theatre, which allows you watch previously games from any point of view and camera angle you can think of. The multiplayer is the greatest improvement, with new weapons, vehicles, maps, and stats to review after the match ends. Definitely a must-buy game for any Xbox 360 gamer, Halo fan or not!</comment>

    <title>Great notebook case</title>
    <comment>I've had this bag for a few months now and I love it. I purchased it when BB was running 50% off on Targus cases, which in my opinion is the only way to buy this bag. It's quite expensive, but really worth it if you need a lot of storage space and the ability to tote your 17" notebook. There are dividers in each section of the bookbag (there are three sections), plus tons of small pockets for other stuff. In addition, the straps are great. They are padded very nicely and extra wide for added comfort. I think $90 is a bit much to spend on a notebook case, but this is probably the best option for someone on the go, especially a student. If you can wait for a sale, do it, but if not this is a great product.</comment>

    <title>Not Too Bad</title>
    <comment>Okay, I'll admit that the bullet in the Eye was great cinema. Other than that I was underwhelmed. Maybe I missed the Super that C. Reeves brought to the part of Superman. Or the horrendous nerdiness that Reeves brought to Clark. Mr. Routh seemed just a bit too dorky as Superman, and a bit too cool as Clark. It wasn't a one or a two though, because, despite all of it's pitfalls, this is Superman, and it could have been worse, it could have been "Superman: The Quest for Peace".</comment>

    <title>super-awesome game</title>
    <comment>The game has to be the best ever made, completely revolutionizing online gaming for gamers around the world. The online and campaign are awesome, supporting great graphic and very little lag. It is played by people all over the world and was anticipated by almost every gamer out there. Its game types and maps are outstanding compared with other games out there. Halo 3 has taken over the xbox 360.</comment>

    <comment>I have long known the Verbatim products and have never been unhappy with them. This last purchase only shows that once again. I was looking at TDK and Memorex but found bad reviews for them. Spend the extra 2 bucks and got a brand I know and trust. 100% quality</comment>

    <title>Great game</title>
    <comment>This game exceded my expectations and more. The online play is the most fun experience you could have playing a game. Whether youre a hard core gamer or dont play at all this game has something for everyone. The xbox live part of this game keeps you on the 360 for hours apon hours. Its the deepest most fun multiplayer and online game that has ever hit consoles. The campaign mode is once again enthralling and leaves you on the edge of your seat. The only bad thing about this game is the backtracking in campain mode which has improved since the first two installments but is still present. that and the friends and work you will miss because of the amount of time youll be playing this Buy this game!</comment>

    <comment>I enjoy the songs on this game. Some I had never heard of before, but of course you catch on quickly. I just wish tere was more new options on this game. I was expecting for it to be a lot more different than Guitar Hero I &amp; II.</comment>

    <title>Great Movie</title>
    <comment>Movie is based on Frank Millers graphic novel 300, this movie has it all, great action and a very graphic novel look to it, the movie goes more for the tale of the 300 spartans last stand, than historical fact, but movies are for entertainment than making sure it got every historical fact right, when I seen 300 at the theatre I never looked at my watch, the time went fast, other than being somewhat slowed down by the sidestory with the Spartan queen. I would recommend this movie, if your a fan of action movies or even good war movies, this will fit the bill, Zack Synder did a wonderful job directing this movie, and the battle scenes are simply amazing, and the CGI is not overdone, it blends in nicely with the live characters and story, the movie does have graphic scenes of violence and some nudity and adult themes, Rated R, I wouldn't recommend kids being able to watch this. I have the regular edition DVD, with just the commentary and trailer, if you want more info on the movie and features I would recommend the special edition.</comment>

    <comment>I liked it , it was ok. I just thought there was too much going on at one time. I loved the comic books since I was a kid. In this movie, they ignored the comics and rewrote the story. I was let down by the changes. Simple formula: Follow the comic and all will be well.</comment>

    <title>Great new album</title>
    <comment>This album has been anticipated by Ingram Hill fans for awhile since it has been a couple of years since their last studio album. "Cold in California" was definitely worth the wait. Fans will enjoy every song on the album, and the title track is a particular favorite of mine. If you're a fan of IH, this album is a must-have. If you are looking to discover a new band, this album will not disappoint. Give it a try!</comment>

    <title>A Good Buy</title>
    <comment>I personally would recommend this game to anyone who is into playing multiplayer. It is especially great over Xbox Live and the maps are well layed out. The multiplayer also works just fine for groups on one system or more systems over a network. The only problem is that campaign is too short and only consists of nine levels. Of corse they fallow the lay level layer out of having city maps first, a flood infested map in the middle, and the last map or so in a forerunner building. It just leaves more to be desired from the last game in an amazing trilogy. But other than a less than expected campaign, the game is great with excellent graphics and an amazing multiplayer that is to expected from the Halo series.</comment>

    <title>Classic for the Ages</title>
    <comment>With this film, Universal Pictures unleashed its last horror creation onto the world: The Creature from the Black Lagoon. As well as earning its way into cinema history, this movie quickly earns its way into any viewer's heart. I absolutely loved this film! Everything about it is instant movie gold! Who can ever forget the terrifying Gill-man, the courageous David Reed, or the magnificently beautiful Kay Lawrence? There are so many memorable scenes; the one with Gill-man swimming only an arm's length away from the unaware Kay sends shivers down my back every time I see it, and the first appearance of Gill-man golden. This movie is such a classic, and the best thing is that it's just a good, old-fashioned horror film. It's funny, campy in that 1950s kind of way, and genuinely frightening a lot of the time. I can honestly say a perfect night is curling up on a couch, cracking open a bag of popcorn and watching this movie. And you can bring the whole family onto the couch with you, since people of all ages can watch and enjoy this masterpiece. So if you've never seen Creature, go and see it now, because you're denying yourself a real treasure!</comment>

    <comment>I love this game. It is a fun game to play, the people at bungie put hours and hours into the making of the game. Xbox live is almost a must to experience the fun gameplay or even playing with friends in a system link is fun. If you play this game you will understand exactly why it is such a big deal to everybody. If you buy this game you wont be dissapointed at all.</comment>

    <title>The GoBots?</title>
    <comment>Alot in this movie made no sense! It may have well been the GoBots movie! They didn't stick to the original story, Bumblebee isn't a Volks Wagon Bug ...Very few robots I could even remember were even in the movie. The fight scenes were hard to distinguish between who was who. The audio for this dvd release I heard isn't in DTS. All the money they took in for this thing would make you think they wouldn't get cheap but, I assume they did.</comment>

    <title>A mid way between 2 movies</title>
    <comment>Great series. I wished there were more shows on the way but, oh well. Better enjoy what there is of it. This show was a sort of mid way point between Spiderman 1 and 2. You'll enjoy it!</comment>

    <title>Project's best yet</title>
    <comment>I've been with Project since their second release Drawing Black Lines (their heaviest) and now we have Rival Factions (their lightest album). As Project fans know, each album is very different from the last, with the sound being consistent throughout each album. The change in Rival Factions is the biggest ever, however. It has a She Hates Revenge sound mixed in with electronic and lighter rock, and I find it their best since Drawing Black Lines, which is their most popular album. The sound is creative and lyrics well thought out (always a highlight), though not as dark as previous albums. Definitely recommended, just check out the sound direction the band is taking before buying.</comment>

    <comment>ADAM SANDLER IS AT HIS BEST. THIS MOVIE IS EMOTIONAL AND A TEARJERKER. DO NOT EXPECT THE USUAL SMARTA** SANDLER- HE SHOWS HE HAS HIS SHOWN HE CAN ACT HERE. SUPPORTING CAST IS AWESOME. THERE ARE SOME POINTS WHERE YOU WOULD NOT WANT A KID TO WATCH- MIGHT HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT VERY GOOD</comment>

    <title>Classic PC Game</title>
    <comment>I have been a longtime fan of this game and was happy to see it in a box set. My hundreds of hours playing this game were well spent (whatever else I may have needed to do) because so much thought went into making this game endlessly enjoyable. The most important facet of the game's high quality is the balanced yet varied gameplay. The game designers somehow found ways to make each of the three races unique and yet able to fight the other two. In addition, the advanced units are all totally different but can all change a game. I have enjoyed playing as all three races because they all require a new strategy. A nice component of the game that otherwise goes overlooked is the background music, but with this game it was a hit. I would pay for a CD of the soundtrack because it really is that good. One con is that it is sometimes hard to coordinate large attacks with the unit control system. A player can only select 12 units at a time, so it can take a while to direct an offensive move with large numbers of several types of units. Overall, though, this game is easily in my personal top three of most enjoyed games in my lifetime.</comment>

    <title>OK Flick but thought is was going to be better</title>
    <comment>I heard many great things about this movie, however only found it to be average. Now am I also the type that believes that everyones opinion is different especially when it comes to movies. So if you are interested in this movie you may want to rent it first.</comment>

    <title>Something New</title>
    <comment>I thought it was an interesting movie. I wasn't quite fond of how it was based on dog fighting because that's animal cruelty. However, I thought it was a good movie; it was something new to me to see something like this. I recommend this movie to those people who like to try new things and see new things. This movie is not for the faint of heart though so take caution because its pretty graphic.</comment>

    <title>Horror is the way to go!</title>
    <comment>This movie is just great! It's sort of like the dawn of the dead meets hannibal. I just love this movie because it has a great plot. I love horror movies so I just loved this movie naturally. Those who love horror movies should definitely wath this movie; pop in the popcorn and have a scare! There's cannibalism and disgusting looking aliens-you will so love this.</comment>

    <title>Killer...</title>
    <comment>This show is great. Essentially it is about a serial killer of bad people, but there are so many other things going on that that phrase doesn't really do the show justice. It is intriguing and well acted, plus very bloody (if that kind of thing matters to you). Each episode expounds upon the previous one, making viewing multiple episode back-to-back a must. The picture quality and sound are very good. The only thing lacking is any substansian bonus material (the biggest extra is two episodes of "Brotherhood," another Showtime show). But the episodes are good enough that it is almost a minor quibble. Season two can't come out on DVD soon enough!</comment>

    <title>A real classic</title>
    <comment>This movie is simply brilliant. Christian Bale plays his character Patrick bateman so well. He is such a great actor. In this movie you really get into the mind of the serial killer which I find intriguing. I was so into this movie that I thought it was actually real for a second. This movie is a great thriller to watch on a friday night! I seriously advice that you watch this movie because you will watch it over and over again like me.</comment>

    <title>Vampires</title>
    <comment>Everybody loves a movie that has vampires and werewolves; those who like horror movies just like me. This movie is all about the dominant species, therefore, you can conclude that the vampires and werewolves are at it both competing for that dominant position. I always loved vampire and werewolf movies. This movie was a real treat for me because I thought it was brilliant! I give props to the director because he has a great imagination; they did a great job on this movie. I recommend this movie to anybody who loves vampires and werewolves as much as I do; or those who like a little scare once in a while.</comment>

    <title>Awesome Show</title>
    <comment>Harvey Birdman is an awesome show! If you are a fan of the old Hanna-Barbera cartoons, then you will love this spoof series. This is not your normal show for kids though. This is geared towards the older audience (the ones that remember these shows when THEY were little). I would recommend this show to any lovers of the "old cartoons."</comment>

    <comment>I first saw tremors when I was like 12 years old and I still love it. I'm a horror movie loving girl so this movie was definitely my cup of tea. It's all about this huge mutant carnivore worms that eat people; and get this they see by body heat. It's brilliant! I saw all the tremor movies and I just fell in love with them. I've watched them over 50 times because they are that great! You should definitely buy this movie because you'll never look a worms the same way again.</comment>

    <title>Better than Star Wars!</title>
    <comment>I just took my entire family to see this movie today on the big screen. My kids were thrilled! I grew up with the Transformer cartoons when I was a kid and always loved it. So when they made this movie I was sceptical. I thought it would be very similiar to the let down that I had when I saw the Hulk. The special effects were amazing and how they made the machines seem real and almost human like was fantastic!!! I found myself on the edge my seat the whole time wanting to know what was going to happen next. I was almost sad it was over!! When we walked out of the movie theatre I told my husband that we are going to purchase Transformers as soon as we can purchase it. So here I am preordering this movie to have as soon as possible. I highly recommend this for all those generation x'ers out there that loved the cartoon and for all of our new little ones who will love it too!!!</comment>

    <comment>There's no way I can be sad/depressed watching this movie. Steve does a phenomenal job as the 40-year old virgin. From his job at the stereo store to his visit to the local Planned Parenthood to his infamous waxing scene (which was really done), his reactions and commentary are dead on and make for a movie that provides laugh after laugh, while still telling a relatively "cute" story. Perfect for a date movie...boys and girls alike will like it.</comment>

    <title>Back to Ancient times</title>
    <comment>I really like this movie because it deals with ancient egypt history; it is also set in egypt. I have always been intrigued by mummies and ancient egyptian afterlife beliefs. This movie dealt with both of these things. It also has treasure hungry adventures and the beautiful Rachel Weisz. Those who love horror mixed in with some ancient history will definitely love this movie.</comment>

    <title>Near Perfect</title>
    <comment>This movie is for you, especially if you're into the anime series "Basilisk" or if you just plain like action/romance movies about ninja. The cinematography is great and it has a excellent cast. I was a big fan of the beautiful Nakama Yukie (Oboro) and after watching this, I got way more than I expected. It could use a little more action from the main characters but other than that, all the action scenes were perfect. For the romance lovers, this is also a great movie for you to watch. I guess you can say that it's kind of like Romeo and Juliet except ninja-style.</comment>

    <title>Bitter Sweet</title>
    <comment>What I liked about this movie is that it was strictly to the point. It never leaves you in an unknown midst of curiosity. It is simply horror from minute to minute. Cannibalism to its sickest and human brutality at its worst. For those with a weak stomach this movie will be torture but for those who like it horrifically brutal you will definitely be overwhelmed by this movie. It is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. When you go to bed you'll hear that chainsaw running. ;)</comment>

    <comment>I did not want to purchase online fearing it would not be compatible and I did not want to wait for it to arrive in the mail, so I purchased in the store today (and it was on sale). Had plenty in stock and sales associate assured me it was compatible. Had Geek Squad install - once I turned on my computer when I got home, instantly noticed a difference. Computer was not sluggish any more. If your in doubt if you should upgrade, don't hesitate - go for it!</comment>

    <comment>I thought this was such a great suspense movie. I was so intrigued by the plot of this movie. What I really liked about this movie was that it was a trick movie; it leaves you so freaked out at the end. Its all about a babysitter who starts getting calls from some freak that wants to kill her while she is babysitting some kids in a remote area where help is miles away. You will never want to babysit after you watch this movie. You will definitely love this movie though.</comment>

    <title>Teen Witches</title>
    <comment>I liked this movie because it was different from all the witch movies I have ever seen. It was something new; witches going against each other; bringing aquatic animals out the water; a complete freak show. It was quite humorous too; some parts will just make you laugh even though they are not meant to be funny. I never knew a witch could go crazy (lol). This is a movie you can watch with your girls on a friday night and have some fun with some dark magic!</comment>

    <title>Greatest Movie Ever</title>
    <comment>The first of the three movie's in Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In...This movie is one of the best, if not THE, greatest movie ever.The acting from Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale, and the late great Charles Bronson are some of the best you will ever see.The way it was shot is amazing taking in the beatiful Monument Valley to the Grey Hills of Spain. If you can handle the long runtime it has then you will be rewarded with one of the greatest endings ever caputered on film. In short Buy it because its cheap and its worth every penny.</comment>

    <title>great puchase</title>
    <comment>This is a good product, it has good ink color. We have never had a problem with it leaking in our printer as other ink cartridges have. The hp ink cartridge may cost a little more than others, but it was well worth the cost considering the quality!</comment>

    <title>Brilliant</title>
    <comment>I read the other reviews on this product just to see if others agree. And they do! This really is the best backpack ever! A bit pricey but worth more. I love the reinforced handle, epescially when I've filled the main pocket with books. I used it throughout my trip to japan, and it was super useful. I've already recommended it to my sister, and will recommend it to everyone else I know. Brilliant piece of equipment.</comment>

    <title>Husband loves this purchase</title>
    <comment>I purchased this movie for my husband because he loves this movie. I sent it to him in Iraq since he is so far away from home. I wathced it before i sent it to him and i just thought it was wonderful. I didnt think i would like it so much, but i would watch it again. It drew me in and made me sit there watching seeing what is going to happen. I was amazed how wonderful the movie really is. I would recommend it to anyone.</comment>

    <title>BEST MOUSE EVER</title>
    <comment>Once this mouse came it was outstanding. The appearance and size was just what i was looking for. It was great. The mouse installation disc took only 2 minutes and it has so many cool features. I especially love it during game play. Because of this magnify glass it has featured in it. No more scoping for me its just bam and they are dead. It also has four way scrolling which was also very useful. I have to say, for one of the wireless mouses i have gotten, this one was great.</comment>

    <title>Old School With a New Twist!</title>
    <comment>I grew up in the 80s, and therefore LOVE Mario games. I feel like this is the first Mario game to come out since the last Super Mario that lives up to the name of the Marioverse. There are lots of old tricks, and new tricks. There are secrets and collectables, and of course a slippery princess who is always just out of reach for rescuing! I do wish it could have been a little longer. I thought the difficulty level was perfect for me. There were challenging bits, but nothing a little repitition couldn't solve. Some hard core gamers will probably find it to easy, and possibly boring, and less-skilled gamers might find bits of it frustrating.</comment>

    <title>One Cute Movie</title>
    <comment>THIS WAS ONE CUTE MOVIE. OUR 4-YR-OLD LOVED IT. THERE WASN'T THE REFERENCES TO ALL THE SWEET FOODS YOU GET WITH MOST OF THE OTHER STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE MOVIES AND DVD'S. THERE WAS A PLOT SHE COULD UNDERSTAND AND FOLLOW, AND WE DIDNT GET BORED OF IT VERY QUICKLY LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER CULT CHILDRENS MOVIES. THE SCORE WAS A HUGE SUCCESS AND THE CD WOULD BE WORTH GETTING ALONG WITH THE MOVIE.</comment>

    <title>I wanna ROCK</title>
    <comment>Guitar Hero II is a definite improvement on Guitar Hero. They made it easier to do the hammer on and pull off moves that were really iffy in the first game. They also used the success of the first game to get an even BETTER list of hit songs for the set lists this time around. It's the rare game that builds on a prior game (Japanese hit Guitar Freaks) and makes it SO much better, but the Guitar Hero series does it! I highly recommend getting a wireless guitar for this because the game makes you want to ROCK, and it's hard to do that with wires attached!</comment>

    <comment>Main story is a bunch of friends with different skills (explosive expert, hacker, driver, leader, safe cracker) are going to steal some gold from a bad person. Its a well thought out story though from beginning to end, i dont want to give out to many details on the plot. All the actors do great jobs in this movie. And after watching this movie, youre going to want to go out and buy a MINI COOPER. I know i do.</comment>

    <comment>The commercials would make you think its one of those award winning films where its good to watch but nothing fun happens. Well this is a great film, on both scales. Its a great movie for those who love dramas and serious stories like Green Mile. But its also a great movie for action fans. Essentially the story is pretty much about guys getting revenge by doing hits, using car bombs, guns, etc.</comment>

    <title>So far so good</title>
    <comment>I purchased this phone from another store (same price) so I decided to come home and research it via internet. I was suprised to see that only a few stores carried this phone, and futher no one had reviewed it. What I can first say about the phone is, it is very sleek and stylish. I am a fan of V-tech so for me to purchase another brand was hard. I am very pleased with the phone overall, the different ringtones are nice also. One of my favorite features is you can use the speakerphone function while the phone is in the cradle charging. This phone is worth a try, however make sure you ask about the return policy just in case.</comment>

    <title>Favorite Film</title>
    <comment>If you dont like Batman movies, i dont blam you because Joel Schumacher really ruined the name of Batman with his campy Batman movies. But give Batman a chance. This is the movie you should watch. If you know nothing about Batman, then youll like this movie more. The story takes place right at the begining, ignoring all previous Batman movies, and just starts the Franchise over. The whole movie explains the troubles with Bruce Wayne, and why he feels necessary to do something as crazy as dress up as a Bat and fight crime. Its a serious film that shouldnt be missed</comment>

    <title>A true work of art...</title>
    <comment>This album isn't an ordinary Foo Fighters album. If you are used to their arena rock style and don't like when bands mature, then this CD may not be for you. The way the music is composed on this album is breathtaking to say the least and Dave Grohl is a mastermind of the music he creates. Some standout tracks on this album are: The Pretender Let It Die Erase/Replace Long Road To Ruin Stranger Things Have Happened The Ballad of the Beaconsfield Minors Don't get me wrong...all of the songs are excellent but those are just my favorite. The guitar and drum work on these songs are very impressive and still continue to after many listens. I highly recommend this album for anyone who loves Foo Fighters and likes a little something different. Don't wait...buy it now!</comment>

    <comment>This is only 6 episodes, that's something everyone who buys this should be very aware of. But they were good ones, they still hold up today. And there are a lot of commentaries, the pilot even gets two. Well worth it for a big fan of the show.</comment>

    <title>Great Purchase</title>
    <comment>I was a serious player of the first 2 especially overseas whilw deployed with the military,which turned me on to the Slayer part of the game. I held out to buy a 360 until HALO 3 was released. WOW! the graphics as well as the storyline to this game are surreal. I am not one of those people who sit down and try to beat it as fast as I can and not enjoy the story of the game it took me a week but it seemed rather short. The extras they added to the game like pulling the plasma cannons and turret mounted weapons off the tripods was a great addition as well as adding the new items like spike grenades ect... I havent had a chance to play online but am looking forward to it. Again Bungie and Microsoft have done a superb job worthy of adding the game to the archives of keepers and not selling it or trading it in.</comment>

    <comment>Overall I think it's an amazing game to play and the graphics are on point. The controls are difficult to get used to at first, but gets easier as the game progresses. I would not recommend this game for a young kid due to the graphic nature of the game and the confusing controls.</comment>

    <title>Hilarious!!!</title>
    <comment>This movie was amazing when I first saw it and its still hilarious now. I've seen the movie and bonus features over and over again and they never get old. The 2-disc version has all the extras that you would hope for. There's a lot of extra funny scenes/events that were cut out of the movie that you'll only find in this version. Worth paying the extra money for the 2-disc version. Highly recommended!!!</comment>

    <comment>The movie itself is well thought out. No monsters or humans killing people, but a room that would drive people into insanity to kill themselves by showing their weaknesses. Cusack and Jackson both deliver in their respective roles to drive this story. The only problem I had with this movie was the beginning until Jackson's appearance. This part had to be told to understand Cusack's character, but it had the tendency to drag the movie and left a bitter taste to the movie. But overall, the movie was well executed. The acting carried this what could have been a B-movie. It gives people a different kind of thriller.</comment>

    <comment>Kanye is a uniquely talented musician. He appeals to both the rap and rock worlds. With Graduation, he not only inspires us with "Stronger," but also makes us laugh with the track, "Drunk and Hot Girls." One of the most lyrically sound CD's I have heard to date.</comment>

    <title>Dlink Xtreme N-router</title>
    <comment>I had a Linksys WRT150 router (x2) .. after many problems/drops/no startup connection with wireless connectivity, I decided to switch to try a different brand. This router works great! I have 3 Vista machines and set up this router in minutes WITH WPA2-AES. No noticeable slowdown with encryption enabled. Runs a little warm, but not unreasonable. Currently using a wired PC, wireless desktop, and Toshiba Satellite laptop, all with N. In the near future may also run the new Dlink Media extender and possibly an iCam.</comment>

    <title>great</title>
    <comment>must say, I have been pretty excited about this upcoming series. A TV show about superheroes with complex plots and a large cast, not to mention the fact that it isn't a hokey send up like some past series - Birds of Prey comes to mind pretty fast - all these things had me jazzed for the pilot. The show really hit the ground running, unfortunately a lot of the episode had already been seen in the previews. For me, that made it a bit anti-climactic. The good thing was the introduction of a villain character and revelation as to who in the cast he has connections with. This "villain" is sure to be a large part of the series as we see how these people actually got their powers.</comment>

    <title>piece of junk</title>
    <comment>This is a piece of junk. I think you can find something better on the shelf than this. I would not even rate a 1 but had to give it a rating. The bar going in circles loosens and have to keep tightening. Is supposed to have auto shut off and it does not..if you leave it gets black and burned and smells and smokes. Not for teens or anyone to handle because the lid does not stay on, its just there and dangerous to flip with the steam.The popcorn is chewy and does not taste good- save your money buy mircrowave bags or look around here for something better- this one may have a great name behind it but its cheap and not worth the money.</comment>

    <title>Very good collection of songs</title>
    <comment>Not quite what we have come to expect from Jeremy Camp because he favors the electric guitar on this CD. However with that being said the songs are still very good and well composed. If you are a fan of the more eletric sound this will be a great CD for you.</comment>

    <title>pretty much a 3 month high</title>
    <comment>i've bought 3 of these Sony ear pieces before, and after a couple months, one of the ear pieces would stop working, at first i thought it was because of how brutal i was with the first one, but with the third one, they hardly left the desk and still broke. as i said before they're pretty much a 3 month high, then one of the ear pieces just die. feel free in buying these, it might just be my luck with headphones that they die on me, but after the third one, i just stopped buying these :/</comment>

    <title>Grade: B-</title>
    <comment>Of the twelve shorts featured on this DVD, only four feel like real and complete stories. They are all impressive when compared to most student films in terms of style and technique but too many of them fall into the category that many short films are: gimicky or incomplete; that is they don't feel like movies but parts of a longer movie. The interviews with George Lucas and Robert Zemeckis (whose films are among the better ones in the collection) are highlights on the DVD and so are the films Electronic Labyrinth, Proof, Whatever It Takes, and Broken Record. It's not a terrible DVD, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see these movies.</comment>

    <title>Disappointing</title>
    <comment>I had been looking for one of Howie's stand up routine and ordered this via Best Buy. This was a very silly routine where you can tell he is very green in his comedy. I could only watch the first 20 minutes or so. If you are interested in the talented comedian, please get the other DVD.</comment>

    <title>Could not be more pleased!</title>
    <comment>The size of the backpack is exceptional. It has been ideal for carrying not only my computer but everything I lug around in NYC, either stopping at the store or heading to work. The pockets are accessible and suit all of my needs. With the purchase of my computer, I received an additional discount but it is worth every cent full price.</comment>

    <title>Best Movie In The 'Verse</title>
    <comment>Joss Whedon and his underdog legion of Browncoats did it! Not only is this movie incredible but the story of its coming about is even more so. I encourage any Sci-Fi or drama fan to check it out and then follow the timeline backwards to see where Serenity came from. It's well-worth the trip and a good heart-wrenching story to boot.</comment>

    <title>Solid Steel!</title>
    <comment>Like other switches, there's no configuration to mess with. Just plug it in and it works. It has that Netgear solid steel case you could use to hold up a car--no wimpy plastic cases here. It supports Jumbo frames for faster throughput. And it has no fan to make noise, clog with dust, or wear out. It's a good choice.</comment>

    <title>Great animation and storytelling</title>
    <comment>I really enjoyed watching this movie. It's definitely better than the Marvel movies. DC really needed this. This is what they should have done for the Superman Returns movie in my opinion. This is the Death and Return of Superman comics abbreviated and adapted for the screen. I would have like to have seen the 4 Supermen that appeared after his death but they went with a different direction that worked somewhat. Definitely some great battle sequences here. It's good to see the original animated series team back working on this. Although, I really didn't like how they drew Superman's face. The voice talent is great. I takes some getting used to for Lois Lane but it works at the end. Definitely pick this up if you're a fan of the animated series.</comment>

    <title>Recomended to DJ's!</title>
    <comment>My girlfriend bought me this back pack because I am a mobile DJ. This bag fits my Dell Vostro 1000 (with 15.4" screen), but Serato Scratch Live box, my external hard drive, headphones, cables for all of the above, backup CD's, and there is still plenty of room for more!!! The straps are very comfortable around your shoulders and the reinforced handle on the top reassured you that it will not tear when lifting a loaded backpack. I didn't realize the price was somewhat high when she purchased it, but I will definetly contest that it is WORTH IT!</comment>

    <comment>For this to be his first cd, it was really enjoyable from beginning to end. The music and lyrics were just right. It is definitely something that I can listen to with my mate or when I am just riding in the car alone. What I like most about this cd is he was consistent with his music. For a second I thought that "Bed" would be the only good song, but you can pick any song at random to listen to and you will have the same feeling. I believe this artist has a bright future in music and I definitely recommend this product to any and everyone.</comment>

    <title>Excellent Game</title>
    <comment>Oblivion is a great addition to the Morrowind series. Familiar races to play are back again for previous fans of the series. A great amount of customization can go into your character's physical looks, which is a wonderful addition. Gameplay is fun, but the game rushes suggestions on what new thing to try out (such as check out your inventory! try attacking this rat!), which can be hard on people new to the series. The game manual is helpful if you happen to miss a suggestion during this phase of the game. I also suggest having a powerful processor and video card, or else expect to turn the graphics WAY down. It is a beautiful world, but a very intense one to process. Overall, Oblivion is a very entertaining game that one can be engrossed in for hours. I highly suggest buying it to any fan of RPG gaming.</comment>

    <title>Hours of Fun</title>
    <comment>I played this game at a friend's house, and immediately purchased it the next day. Although it's a little hard to get used to the strumming and fret buttons, once you do it's nearly impossible to stop playing. With all the different songs, you rarely get tired of the song selection. You don't have to be playing this game to enjoy it (although playing is better), it's also entertaining to just watch your friends play while you wait your turn.</comment>

    <title>One of the Best Albums I ever Purchased</title>
    <comment>Coud Cult's Adive From the Happy Hippopotamus is one of the best albums I have ever heard. The album is filled with tons of great tracks. A few of my favorite tracks are You Got Your Bones To Make a Beat, Washed Your Car, Transistor Radio, Clip-Clop, and Car Wash. I personally like the whole album, to me it's one of those albums you can listen to over and over again and not get tired of it.</comment>

    <title>Well Worth Seeing</title>
    <comment>There are very few movies that come out these days that take the viewer so deep into the emotional lives of the characters. This movie captivated me from the beginning and showed the absolute beauty that can be found in knowing another person for who they really are. Unfortunatly ,at least in my town, this movie was not publicized well so many did not see it and that is a shame that should not carry over into the dvd release! I eagerly await and have awaited this release!</comment>

    <title>Funny</title>
    <comment>One of the best stand up movie ever made, and I would put it second after Richard Pryor:Live on Sunset Strip of course. To me the best one was Bernie Mac than Cedric The Entertainer, Steve Harvey and D.L. Hughley, but they all performed with their own style and greatness.</comment>

    <title>Four Funny Queens</title>
    <comment>I love this movie, but of course its not better than Kings of Comedy, even though they give those guys a little run for their money. The best one would be Mo'Nique, than Sommore, than Adele Givens, and Ms. Laura Hayes. Ms. Hayes is funny but she does that 'wig gag' all the time, yet she is still funny</comment>

    <comment>I have literally had this cd in my car player for the last 3 weeks solid and I no more want to take it out now than i did the day i got it! David Crowder is a master of his craft and all should experience his music! He takes the traditional preconcieved notions of gospel music and breaks them creating a new and excellent listening experience</comment>

    <title>Racism isn't always black and white</title>
    <comment>This movie doesn't talk about racism as just a black or white thing, but as people showing their stupidty. It is a great movie to watch, and get to see alot of actors that hit it big in the movies, Ben Affleck, Chris O'Donnell, Anthony Rapp, and others.</comment>

    <title>TFK's Best Album Yet</title>
    <comment>This is Thousand Foot Krutch's best album yet. Very mature lyrics and vocals. Very well done. At first listen to some of their singles on the radio I was a little hesitant to where Krutch was going but they did an excellent job. Very great album, a must have for non-Krutch and Krutch fans alike. Check out "Flame In All of Us", "What Do We Know", and "Falls Apart."</comment>

    <title>Best Alternative Record of 2007!!</title>
    <comment>This record is one of the best alternative records I've heard this year hands down.. Not An Angel is a finely-tuned sonic masterpiece! Every song in this record will blow you away.. From Hotel, into Prototype (The single), Just Another Day, and then into one of my favorite songs- Not An Angel.. City Sleeps has ALL the ingredients you crave, and they have found a way to keep you from skipping tracks to get to your favorite one.. You can listen to this album all the way thru, and you still can't get enough!! I believe Trustkill has found a winner. Watch out for City Sleeps, cause they are taking rock to another level!</comment>

    <title>Good for crowds</title>
    <comment>This game brings out all the best carnival games that you have ever played. As well, it even brings out the sarcastic carnies to your home. The games are recreated well and are fun if you are playig against four, live people. Playing it by yourself can get tiring and boring very quickly. Some games, like Skee Ball, are easy to master, while others, are next to impossible to play or win. But, the vast majority are on the easy side. I would recommend this game if you have small children or really like to host Wii parties and want something new. And, you can't beat the price if you fit this criteria!</comment>

    <comment>by far one of the best shows on television in years but it's a shame to see it go after only two seasons. The last episode is very dramatic and sad, one of the best of the series. Pick this up along with the 1st season as quickly as you can, you will not regret it!!!</comment>

    <title>Addicting game</title>
    <comment>I practically play all day. Sometimes the cd may have a few glitches but all you have to do is to just let it cool down and take it out. Put it back in once it cools down and your good to go. This is probably the most addicting game ever.</comment>

    <comment>Microsoft used the "if it's not broken don't fix it ' rule with this game. It has better graphics and more toys for Master Cheif to play with. Other than that it's the same game as halo 1 and 2 (story line wise). you fight the flood and the convant and try to stop them from destroying the univers. The muli-player part of this game is were you will get most of your fun. and a new co-op mode where you are one convant memeber and the master cheif is pretty cool as well. If you liked the first halos you will most certainly love this one.</comment>

    <title>Suspenseful thriller!</title>
    <comment>This was a great movie of romance and the ultimate revenge! Anthony Hopkins just gets scarier with age. This movie is filled with drama and suspense as Ryan Gosling suspects that Anthony Hopkins killed his wife but can't figure out how he possibly could have disposed of the murder weapon. Hopkins, the ever smooth yet twisted scientist has an answer for everything, however. Will he be able to outsmart Gosling in the end? View the alternate endings on the disk for additional fun!</comment>

    <title>Giant underground wroms</title>
    <comment>The moveis are brought back but the first one is unfortunatly edited, I could tell by the lips not matching the "bad" words, but thats the only one. The story is as follows Giant worms from dino time have come up and start hunting and think anything that makes sound is food, this is bad for anything that moves. They are named Graboids and soon after the one who named them is killed. The next movie follows the first but insted of worms this time thier Shreekers their like the worms but now they have legs and a heat flap on the top of its head that lets it see heat. With these they think anything with heat is food, this is bad for anything warm blooded. In the third movie they are back after many years and bring a new trick to the game they can now fly, Butt(clean version) blasters as they are called are the same as Shreekers but they shoot them selfs into the air from a "explosive gas" and hunt like the Shreekers (anything with heat=food). The final Move is just how people who knew about the creatures faught them in their lillte town of Rejection (no joke thats the name of the town back then). The dvds' extras are various with each dvd the best ones are with the 4th one that tells of how they have done over the years and how they did everything. Its a good buy with good extras that would make any monster fan proud.</comment>

    <title>Rest stop</title>
    <comment>Edge of your seat - make you squirm in some places - very good for a thriller. Some may not like that the majority of the movie takes place in one place but I rather like slasher/thriller movies like this because I like seeing how they do or don't get out. ie - Saw 2 &amp; Kane See No Evil.</comment>

    <title>Dragons live</title>
    <comment>The story is that while mineing in England miners find a dragon's nest and the eggs and "dragon father" wake and start killing and driveing the humans underground. This is were we start as a group of people try to live and not be killed. This comes to an end when a small army of Americans come and start killing the dragons arund them. This makes the dragons mad and this makes them roast the humans home. Who is left after decides to kill the dragon father (only one male and tons of females, kill the male kill all) and take back the world. Its a good mive that would make some dragon lovers mad but it is a good movie for many.</comment>

    <title>My Favorite PJ Album!</title>
    <comment>this is my favorite PJ album. it's a 2 disk album and full of originals you just don't hear that often, plus some favorites you might hear on the radio and not realize were a rarity at one point.</comment>

    <title>Joey's GrEAT!!!</title>
    <comment>I absolutely loved the first season of Joey. The show was hilarious and so were each character with their own individuality...they really showed Joey in his actor life and him with his family, his neighbors. Overall very good.</comment>

    <title>Okay, but not great</title>
    <comment>I was really disappointed with this cd. I had higher expectations, due to the fact that his previous albums "Get Rich or Die Tryin" and "Massacre" were well put together. The sounds and beats in this album compared to previous albums were poorly produced. The only songs that are worthy on this cd are Ayotechnology, I Get Money, and I'll Still Kill. Lately, 50 Cent just doesn't seem to have the motivation he use to have to make albums.</comment>

    <title>These Reviewers Have No Idea What They Are Talking</title>
    <comment>This game is made by the people who made Guitar Hero I and II and Karaoke Revolution I-present. They are the pioneers of video game music. I played the game while on campus during its stop on the bus tour thing and its amazing! The drums are quite a work out and I am a ham so I gave it a go on the singing, I like tapping the mic like a tamborine thing. The screen is not too crowded like you might expect for four music tracks. I also like that there will be a solo career mode for drums to practice before I go on XBox Live with it. I played Guitar Hero II with my brothers kids and they love it so although its bit pricey, I guess it is 4 games in one...so I'm definitely getting it.</comment>

    <title>Very Good Shooter</title>
    <comment>This is my introduction to the Halo series. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the game. However, the game itself is rather shorter than I had anticipated. I believe that the multi-player online modes help make up for the lack of story development. So if you are buying this game solely for single player mode, I would have to say that you will not be getting the full Halo 3 experience.</comment>

    <title>Pretty fun game</title>
    <comment>The game's pretty decent. Its different from Pokemon and gives the player battles similar to RPGs. The new systems in the game are not that difficult to learn as well. The only thing you might not like is having to de-digivolve your Digimon from time to time. He/She does go back to level 1, but you keep the stats. How crazy is that! If you're into the Digmon series or want to try something besides Pokemon, come on down to BestBuy and grab a copy of this or the Dawn version!</comment>

    <title>As Time Goes By</title>
    <comment>This is the PBS British Comedy Series. It is very entertaining, funny, and enjoyable. This is a story of a couple who are reunited after 40 yrs. This story shares their young love and reasons they didn't stay together and their getting together after 40 yrs. It is a wonderful show and would be enjoyed by all who have been in a relationship for many years. I recommend to everyone in their late 40's to 80's above.</comment>

    <title>Be careful</title>
    <comment>I thought I would quickly say that the product as described works great. The speeds are good and the coverage is an improvement from the 11G version. One word of caution though, I purchased this for our chursh and didn't get the coverage we wanted. All be it better than with the 11G vewsion it didn't get to the area we wanted. I then went loking for the extender unit and to my suprise one doesn't exist. A word of caution is you think you might want to us a extender took elksewhere.</comment>

    <title>Gets the job done</title>
    <comment>For $100, you really can't beat this product -- I have a new Sony HTIB system, and hooked the rear speakers up with this system, and I'm very impressed with the sound -- before I hooked both the left and rear surround channels to the wireless system, I just hooked the right rear to the wireless rocketfish system and left the left rear "wired" to the sony to compare the two sides -- the "wired" side was a little louder, but when I adjusted the sound levels to match, I couldn't really tell (with 5.1 programming and music) which was wired and which was wireless. ** When you shut the AV system off, and the Rocket fish sending unit and receving unit are still on, there is a low level "humm" from the rear channels ** Apparently, after reading up online about this issue, Rocketfish has resolved this issue by incorporating some resistors into the 2 foot cables that connect the AV receiver to the Rocketfish sending/transmitting unit. Apparently, those who've already received and implemented these wires are very satisfied with the decrease and/or abscence of the humm. I called the 1-800 helpline in the manual for this product, told them about my humm, and the guy had NO idea what I was talking about -- he wanted me to send them the entire unit or return it for a new one at Best Buy -- I told them NO WAY .. it took too much time to move my furniture and wire this thing up, I wanted the "corporate fix" I"ve read about online -- so he had a corporate agent call me back 1 week later and she stated that I too would receive these updated cables to fix my problem. We'll see when they get here, but either way, the humm is so low that you really have to put your ear up to the speakers to hear it. Also, I have a Belkin wireless-G router and so far, NO interference or loss of signal after 1 week of constant use of both the rocketfish and the wireless internet which is all in the same room. Give it a shot, there's a 30 day return policy, no restocking fee, you can't go wrong if you have a few extra hours this weekend to calibrate it and play around with it.</comment>

    <title>Best Pouge Album ever!!!</title>
    <comment>This is my favorite pogues album ever. This album you can listen to over and over again. Shane MacGowan has been my favorite singer/song writer since i was 12 years old. Since i was a kid i have listed to all his music. Take a listen to lullaby of london, and fairytale of new york. The opening song title is also great. I would recommend getting the re-mastered edition of this album itb includes 6 extra songs on it.</comment>

    <comment>This movie takes place 2 years after the best seller Final Fantasy VII for the PS1, with awesome graphics, a truly wonderful storyline, the same characters we've come to love, part of the Final Fantasy VII compilation, it is simple, if you are Final Fantasy fan, this is a MUST HAVE, if you are not, you can be sure you will be buying a great piece of cinematic &amp; direction art. Square Enix is just awesome. A+</comment>

    <title>Outstanding Remote</title>
    <comment>I bought this remote for one reason only, I washed my other one in a load of laundry. After several attempts with trying to get it to dry out and changing batteries I gave up. So I went looking for a new remote and a Best Buy associate pointed this one out. I really didnt want to pay alot for a new remote, so this was the best bang for the buck out there. Programming took no time at all, and out of all the remotes I have ever used (and this isnt the first time I have washed a remote) this was by far the easiest and quickest remote I have ever seen. I would recommed this remote to anyone, and I will more then likely be buying another one once I wash my living room remote.</comment>

    <title>The data presented are not accurate</title>
    <comment>Wrong statement Quote: "... famous 19th century Yugoslavian inventor". In 19th century Yugoslavia didn't exist. Yugoslavia was formed in 1918 as artificial union, therefore Tesla was not Yugoslavian inventor. Tesla was Croatian inventor. He was born in central part of Croatia - Smiljan. Tesla is one of dozens Croatian inventors that were product of Croatian education system (a torpedo, propeller, first refillable pen, first success full parachute etc ...). At the same time Serbia was under Ottoman empire with poor school system. Turkish policy was to keep conquered countries illiterate, so if Tesla would be born in Serbia, we would remain just a smart kid. I would give some credit to Croatians. It would not hurt to print facts in the future.</comment>

    <title>Packs a Wallop!</title>
    <comment>Having very much like the first installment, Fantastic Four, I was extremely eager to see the sequel the day it was launched into theaters. Needless to say I did, and it vastly exceeded my expectations. The trailer for the film played mainly upon the Silver Surfer character, leaving almost little to nothing about Von Doom. And so his part in the film was a big surprise. Having only recently switched to Blu-ray Disc, this was a must own title for my extensive collection, and was one that has since become one of my favorites to watch. The film itself is short enough (running only 92 minutes so about 1 hr. and 25 mins. without credits). I cannot understand why so many people bashed the film the way they did. It presented itself as nothing more than an action popcorn flick and delivered on every level. Fox definitely took this film seriously to treat just about every shot with some sort of special effect and CGI technique available. The crispness of this title on Blu-ray was unbelievable. The Silver Surfer could not have looked more realistic, nor could the visuals of the human torch. The audio is equally as impressive and let me just say my subwoofer went into a frenzy during some sequences. All in all, this was a definite must see, and must own title for me and I was just glad to have Doom come back in his full glory. That was the icing on the cake for an already appealing movie.</comment>

    <title>No More tooth fairies!</title>
    <comment>I really liked this movie because they turned a children classic story into a horror movie. I liked every part of this movie because it was just so great. It took being afraid of the dark to a higher level. Stay in the light! You will sleep with the light on after you watch this.</comment>

    <title>Vampires!</title>
    <comment>You just have to love a vampire movie. I always loved movies that had vampire characters because they are classic. The movie business keeps modernizing them and the movies get better and better. Aaliyah stars in this movie, and she plays her character quite well; you'd think she really was a vampire. I thought this movie was great; it left me wanting for more when it ended.</comment>

    <title>Scared Headless</title>
    <comment>This is such a classic story. I remember reading it when I was in the 5th grade. I fell in love with this movie. Johnny Depp is brilliant in in this movie. I had nightmares of that headless horseman for days. It is that scary; makes you want to sleep with the lights on. You'll be so scared; you might as well be scared headless but the question is do you dare?</comment>

    <comment>I thought I would give this a try. It needs to get better real quick or I will have it on Ebay. I like the supporting actor but he doesn't carry the show. I am wondering why this show is considered successful. So far it appears boring and the acting in the first few episodes is insanely bad. I expect better from a HBO show.</comment>

    <title>Surpisingly great film</title>
    <comment>I have seen every Bruce Willis movie. I like him even though he can't act. I was very surprised at this movie. Halle Berry is the whole show. She really shows her acting capabilities. If only she had a better cast to work with. REally worthwhile seeing though. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and that never happens to me. And I always have the ending figured out, but not with this movie.</comment>

    <title>Slimy</title>
    <comment>Truthfully, I thought it was more of a comedy than a horror. It wasn't that scary but it still was a good movie. It was kind of like the dawn of the dead meets alien. It was intriguing to see but lacking that horricficly gruesome action i like to see in horror movies. I'm a hard core horror movie loving person though. It was still good but I wanted it to be more brutal.</comment>

    <title>The King</title>
    <comment>I love this movie! The creatures in this movie look so real like; quite scary the imagination of the people who created them. This part of the movie really brought the big bang! The lord of the rings is a great movie; a true original and definitely a classic. I wonder who's going to top them, maybe nobody! What's funny about this movie is that grown men are fighting over a piece of jewelery; how funny is that?!</comment>

    <title>Best Game Ever</title>
    <comment>This is the perfect ending to the Halo trilogy. The game is one of the best values for your money I have seen in a long time. The multi-player will blow your mind away, especially on X-box live. The worst part of the game is the campaign mode, which I may add is awesome. Basically there is close to nothing wrong with this game. The detail of graphics along with the classic Halo music is fantastic. Plus, with the addition of the Forge and Theatre modes, this game pretty much has it all. A definite must buy.</comment>

    <title>100% Thriller</title>
    <comment>This movie was a real treat for me because it has both my favorite alien creatures in it. I remember watching alien and being so scared to go to bed at night. I loved predator and all the predator movies. So this movie was such a great thriller because it include both this creatures fighting for superiority. It is such a great movie! Alien vs Predator: On which side are you on?</comment>

    <title>Great game</title>
    <comment>This game is absolutely great. It is a fitting conclusion (supposedly!) for a great series. The single player storyline is great. Playing co-op is a blast. The added "skulls" which modify the campaign experience, along with the campaign scoring, which allows co-op players to compete for the best performance, adds unlimited replay value to an already great game.</comment>

    <title>Awesome disc from an inconsistent band</title>
    <comment>The Foo Fighters are one of those bands that tend to please one minute "The Colour and the Shape" and disappoint the next "There is Nothing Left to Lose". Luckily, the newest Foo disc, "Echoes, Silence, Patience, &amp; Grace" is pretty good. The disc opens with the catchy "The Pretender" and continues with the eclectic "Let It Die" that begins acoustically and has a heavy metal finish. From those two tracks alone, it is evident that the rest of the disc will be all over the place. In terms of quality, the slower tracks such as "Stranger Things Have Happened" and "Summer's End" are some of the Foo's best, but the heavier tracks such as "Erase/Replace" and "Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make-Up Is Running)" are few and tend to falter in comparison. Other than the weak harder tracks, the disc is great. My only other complaint being the order of the music, which makes the transitions feel awkward when listening to the disc in its entirety. Cons aside, the Foos have been on an upward climb with "In Your Honor", "Skin &amp; Bones", and their latest since the poor "One by One" and hopefully their next work will be just as good if not better.</comment>

    <title>Best 360 game I own</title>
    <comment>This game has everything a 360 owner wants. Constant challenges, smooth gameplay, and great value. Halo 3 is just so much fun, that you just can't wait to get home to play. The story mode was very interesting to me in that most shooters have no solid storyline. However, Halo 3 has a great story that will keep you into to it until the end. The online matchmaking engine works great. You never have to worry about been thrown in to a game with people at very high levels. You play every online game knowing you have a chance to win.</comment>

    <title>New Norah Jones</title>
    <comment>This CD has a solid, well-rounded playlist. It's not often that I will buy an artist's new cd without hearing a song or two from it first, but anything that Chrisette is on, I would purchase in a heartbeat. Her voice is very unique and has alot of jazz and r&amp;b qualities to it. She has her own distinct sytle, but definitely reminds me of Norah Jones. If you like Norah, you'll love Chrisette!</comment>

    <comment>this is a great followup to her first album. The first several songs are upbeat while the last few songs are more laid back. I think it is a must have for your music collection if you're into music that strays from the ordinary and top 40.</comment>

    <title>Wonderful Tasting Water</title>
    <comment>I ignored changing my filter for at least 4 months past the recommended change date. I noticed one day as I was drinking that the water wasn't tasting as good and had a slight odor- much like tap water. I went out and bought a new filter and wrote a reminder to myself on the calendar to change it when it is due. No longer will I ignore the "expiration" date on the filter!</comment>

    <title>Echoes, Silence, Patience, and Sweetness!</title>
    <comment>I didn't know what to expect when I purchased Echoes Silence Patience &amp; Grace...I wasn't sure whether the Band wanted to recover some of their rocking roots in the early 90's, or do an emotional pop CD much like "In your Honor," but after purchasing the CD it's clear...The Foo Fighter's are out for more then a title as 'just another rock band.' They want to prove to their loyal fans, as well as the rest of the world, that they can't be fit into one definitive genre, and they can switch up their style on a seconds notice. Not only does this CD feature an all acoustic and all instrumental jam out, but it also features classic piano, as well as lyrics that can switch from smooth flowing melodies to screechy anger in a moment. I own every single Foo Fighter's CD, and I appreciate their musical diversity...This CD was impressive not because I am a big Foo Fighter fan, but because I appreciate the musical domination the Foo Fighters have displayed in this Album. If I could give it more then 5 stars I would...Grammy's here we come!</comment>

    <title>Hilarious</title>
    <comment>Ricky Gervais is one of the funniest men on the planet. He created and starred in the original "The Office" and was hysterical as David Brent. I wondered how he could ever top that show and, amazingly, he has. Extras is one of the funniest programs ever. One doesn't have to be interested in what goes on behind the scenes to enjoy this series. And who would have guessed that guest star Patrick Stewart could be so funny and willing to mock himself. This is a series I have shared with numerous friends and gotten them all hooked. If you need a laugh, this is the DVD to buy (along with Extras Season 2).</comment>

    <title>Best Game Ever</title>
    <comment>I knew that this game would be good but it completely blew my mind. Brilliant graphics, and gameplay. I absolutely love the multiplayer maps and the ability to create your own and move stuff around with the forge. I would have to say that this is by far the best game I have ever played.</comment>

    <title>Worth Buying!</title>
    <comment>The Gilmore Girls Complete Seventh Season is totally worth owning in your own home. Each episode of this hilarious show contains so much love and laughter that you would never regret purchasing this box set. Just like all the other Gimore Girls seaons, this is another outstanding hit. This being the final season, so the series finale, makes it even more needed in every home entertainment collection.</comment>

    <title>The Start of a dynasty</title>
    <comment>Welcome to the exciting and groundbreaking world of Dragon Ball Z! This is the first season of the show that picks up where it's predecessor (Dragonball) left off. The show revolves around a collection of Earth's strongest fighters as they unite together to battle the incoming Saiyans (Raditz, Nappa, and Vegeta). If this is your first experience with any of the Dragonball sagas, then you will find yourself sucked into the mythology of this season. This is the best japanese animation show ever made in my opinion, and the first season is the best place if you want to pick it up and start watching. Once you tune out Gohan's incessant and annoying whining, you will be forever hooked on the show.</comment>

    <title>Great Soundtrack</title>
    <comment>This one of the best scores. I can't get enough of the soundtrack and have been listening to it over and over and over again. It's a very good choice if you like powerful orchestral music with a touch of vocals. My favorite songs include "The Battle", "Strength And Honor", and "Now We Are Free". Some music that was in the movie wasn't on the CD.</comment>

    <title>Smallville, Best Season Ever!</title>
    <comment>Season 6 of Smallville is the best ever. The writers have done a great job with the demise of Zod, introduction of the Justice League of America, and of course Lana's realization of Lex's truly evil intent. All of this is wrapped around Clark's maturing as a hero for all of mankind and the beginnings of his relationship with Lois Lane.</comment>

    <title>Doesn't Work as Advertised</title>
    <comment>I was looking for a wireless solution to my surround sound speakers and purchased this system with high hopes. Everything connected great and all lights came on but no sound came from speakers. I tried multiple combinations and even exchanged system for another but had the same results. Very disappointing.</comment>

    <title>Awesome sound for the size.</title>
    <comment>I bought the companion 2 set with little expectations. I was very pleased as this was replacing a more costly 2.1 set (Was trying to free clutter and reduce wires). The sound is very crisp and doesn't distort much at even higher volumes. The Mid's and High's are nice, and it is a tad bit lacking on the Low's but that was to be expected. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something simple, but with a kick.</comment>

    <comment>I recommend everyone who plays video games to get this game. Halo 3 has great graphics, the Xbox Live feature and loads of fun to play with friends.The Xbox 360's graphics and Halo 3's graphics make it like playing in really life! I aslo would say that if you get this game you should definetly get Xbox Live with it to make your playing experience complete. Sincerely, a regualr player of Halo 3</comment>

    <title>One of the best cartoons ever!</title>
    <comment>One of the most overlooked cartoons from the 1960's, Jonny Quest can now be seen by a new generation with all the action and great music that made it one of the best animated series ever. The extras are excellent, especially the vintage commercial that is included in the set. It's a wonderful trip down memory lane when cartoons were truly art.</comment>

    <title>different from 06 but still good</title>
    <comment>MADDEN 07 is a great game to get into. The superstar mode the the coolest it makes you feel like your realy out there playing. The only thing i didnt like is that the controls are totaly different from 06. The only thing that is the same is the tackle button. I would recomend this to anybody looking for a good sports game.</comment>

    <title>best game ever</title>
    <comment>the new installment of halo has everything one could dream of. One of the new multiplayer games is called Forge. With forge, one can add things to the map such as vehicles, weapons, scenery, powerups and more. You can also move things around in the maps, and put yourslef into another spot on the map. The campaign mode has the best storyline out of all three of the halo games, and includes a slew of enemys and weapons. There are 10 new weapons that can be very useful when used correctly. Halo 3 is easily the best of the series.</comment>

    <comment>The single player is bigger and brawnier than anything that's been attempted on a console before. The multiplayer, which already shadowed the competition, has improved to the point of ridiculousness. The new features - Forge, Saved Films, Coop - are frighteningly addictive. And if you don't like any of that, you're always welcome to edit it until you do. All in all, this game will rock your world!</comment>

    <comment>Personally, this is the best FPS game ever made. It has intense online gameplay which is really fun. A player can get into it and play for days nonstop. I play this game whenever I have time. Awesome in style and originality. Everything is great in this game. I'd rate it 9.8/10. Only part I did not like was the ending. I don't want to go into detail for the ending because it would ruin the story. So there you have it. The best FPS game ever made.</comment>

    <title>Halo 3</title>
    <comment>This is an awesome game, if you don't have a 360, you should buy a 360 just for this game. I haven't played the campaign yet, but I have played the multiplayer and forged. It is amazing, its fun doing the forge with friends, also the variety of weapons and equipment just makes it so much of a diverse game because you can play it in so many different ways. I like how they made no "dominant" weapons like they did in Halo 2 with the sword, you can be dominate like with the sniper, but its a skilled weapon the sword wasn't. The only bad thing is that the sniping is much more difficult but I guess it's something to get used to. Get it.</comment>

    <title>A must have for any true Halo fan</title>
    <comment>LIke most Halo fan I have been waiting for this game to come out. After standing in line for about an hour I finally got my hands on my copy of Halo 3. I rushed home and popped into my 360 and awaited my chance to save the universe. I was pleased with the graphics and gameplay. I enjoyed the new weapons (Man how I do love the hammer) and the improved version of old favorite(the neddler). Overall I was very pleased with the game. So if you are one of the few people who dont own this, what the heck are you waiting for. Run out and buy it now.</comment>

    <title>A awful movie</title>
    <comment>This is Ashley Judd's first movie in 2 years so I had high hopes for this movie. What a letdown. The movie is boring and confusing , and just never makes any sense whatsoever. Ashley Judd does do a very good acting job in the film but the script and story are just bad. This movie was based on a play and this may have been a decent play but it makes for a really bad movie. Skip this movie for a rental or a purchase.</comment>

    <title>Excellent Historical Fiction</title>
    <comment>We watched the Emmy award winning Hornblower series after seeing Master and Commander starring Russell Crowe, and found it at least as good, if not better an experience. The acting is excellent all around, and the production values are top notch. They apparently filmed on an actual frigate for the production (which is why they aren't making more; too costly). The DVDs have historical and behind the scenes info, and we learned a bit about life in the british navy from it. Apparently rum was integral to the operation of the Navy. I would believe it considering they grabbed people from bars and forced them to be sailors for years at a time. Ioan Gruffudd and the other actors bring their characters to life over the course of the fictional Hornblower's life from low ranking ensign to Captain of his own ship. If you are looking for a good period piece in the 18th century British navy, this is an excellent series.</comment>

    <title>Templares rule</title>
    <comment>I advise all who like undead movies too buy this classic box set. The Templars are great undead. These movies are good especially for the time they were filled. Great Stories and just fun too own. This comes in a cool coffin set. Also this is just classic undead.</comment>

    <title>Worth the purchase</title>
    <comment>At this point in the show, is where things start to get a little branched out. Some of the storylines were simply ignored here, but others were expanded upon. Overall decent continuation.</comment>

    <title>Best Acid Trip</title>
    <comment>This soundtrack was not just a background for the movie but an character that changed along with the main character. It was a blend of genres that melded with the storyline but enriched it at the same time. IT ROCKED!</comment>

    <title>Could've been great... but...</title>
    <comment>I was really looking forward to this release, but was somewhat disappointed when it finally came out. It could've been really great, but when I think of "Rocks the 80s" I think of hair bands, not Eddie Money, the Vapors or the Go-Gos. There's good selections but a few too many bad ones for my taste. Especially since there are ONLY 30 songs. For the price there should have been at least 40 songs and maybe a few bonus songs similar to the other releases in this series. Having played it for several weeks I can honestly say its as fun as the others but SHOULD'VE BEEN BETTER.</comment>

    <title>Good but not great</title>
    <comment>This CD is a little of a departure from "Silence" and "About a Burning Fire". Those CDs had more singing than "screaming" songs. This song tends to have a little more of the hardcore "screaming" sound to it. If you liked the previous two CDs, give this one a chance. It has some good tracks like "There must be blood under your eyelids", but be aware that it's a little bit more like their very early stuff from "A Thought Crushed My Mind".</comment>

    <title>Amazing DS thatll keep u captivated for months</title>
    <comment>Mario Kart DS is a very fun and exciting game. The controls are very easy: A: Acceleration B: Brake (not used much) Y: Change mini map views X: Use item (not used much) R(ight): Handbrake/Drifting button L(eft): Use item (mostly used for using items) D-Pad: Move And thats it. There are in total 12 characters, 36 karts, and 38 tracks (6 battle tracks and 32 racing tracks) The racing is flawless and fun. Overall, an amazing game:D</comment>

    <title>One of the best summer comedies</title>
    <comment>This movie is very funny with a great cast. It probably has some of the best insults I have ever heard. It is not necessarily a highly quoteable movie, but there are comedic moments. I also highly recommend watching the Alternate Takes and the Line-O-Rama. This is definitely worth the buy and having for your collection. If you are into both of the other big blockbuster comedies from this team, then you will surely like this one as well. The story and message is actually a bit endearing and really makes for a bit more value than your standard "dumb" comedy. Overall the laugh factor combined with plot development create a very likeable movie for most movie enthusiasts</comment>

    <comment>This movie was extremely well made and the sequence of the scenes were magnificent. The plot was somewhat twisted in a sense that you won't expect what you see! I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants suspense and a whole lot of ponderous thoughts!</comment>

    <title>Great game!</title>
    <comment>As a former xbox system owner, this is one of the first xbox 360 games purchased and it rocks! Amazing graphics, particularly the ability to do film-mode where you can folllow your previous actions during gameplay with a "camera" following yourself or "filming" other action in the scene previously played. Lighting effects are photorealistic. Only drawback I have read is the relatively short Campaign mode, but as far as I can tell it's still pretty challenging and I have a long way to go!</comment>

    <title>Album Of The Year</title>
    <comment>Meshell has never released a bad album. Her track record remains unblemished with this masterpiece. She effortlessly blends jazz, funk, R &amp; B and New York noise into an undeniable piece of art. I can easily recommend this to anyone who wants to be challenged while listening to music.</comment>

    <title>Love perseveres above all else</title>
    <comment>This love story will touch the heart of anyone who has loved another from a distance. There were two main currents or themes which made this movie a classic for years to come. The first theme was the undaunting and unstoppable love the main character felt for his love despite or in spite of the hand fate dealt to him. The second theme was his undying love for his sweetheart even after Alzheimers robbed her of recognition of the great love of her life, and the memories they shared.</comment>

    <title>Greatest Product</title>
    <comment>This game is awesome, other than learning the guitar buttons but it was a nice game to play. I had never played this game before until my friend showed me the game and I began playing the game and it was an button addicting game. There is challenges from learning to get the notes right and to click the right buttons, I recommend this game to anyone who is competitive and likes to have fun and enjoy playing challenging games.</comment>

    <comment>I've been listening to Mae for a long time, since Destination B-Sides came out, and i've seen them a couple of times in concert, and they just never disappoint me. This album features a slightly different sound than the previous albums, and I thought about it most when I first got the CD, but as I listen to it, I really detect so many similarities to their previous albums. This is probably my favorite album so far. Two thumbs up!</comment>

    <title>one of the best movie ever created.</title>
    <comment>For the first 30 minutes, the great is infamous. It begins in the June 6th 1944, THE INVASION of Germany in Ohama Beach. The rest, espacially the ending brings a sad but legendary moment of American History. I think everyone should experience a movie like this one.</comment>

    <comment>Just like Halo and Halo 2 the online play is full of people who exploit the glitches in the maps. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of people who play straight up but then you get the people in the multiplayer that glitch and ruin your good time. Why can't you just play the game as is and get better as you play more often??? No, you have to CHEAT to make yourself feel better. Prime characteristics of a true LOSER.</comment>

    <title>Brangelina!!</title>
    <comment>This is a spectacular movie that should be in everyone's dvd collection! It stars both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. There chemistry on screen is amazing..no wonder why they hooked up in real life!! This movie is packed full of action. You can see this real life couple trying to take one another out in fight scenes that are out of this world!! Especially the one at the end when they join sides to protect each other!! If you haven't seen this one you are definately missing out!!</comment>

    <title>Wow is what i have to say</title>
    <comment>This is one of the best games i have played. The Campaign is a blast on co op. I could play it over and over again with a different friend everynight or just do it differently with a same friend. Everything is beatiful to look at. The storyline immerses you in a world you want to be the hero in a world you wish you could put yourself in to kill those aliens. Halo 3 does that in the closest way possible.</comment>

    <title>The best movie ever!!!</title>
    <comment>She's the Man is an awesome movie starring Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum. She's the Man is about Viola, who's soccer team gets kicked out of the budget, and she isn't allowed to play on the boy's team. In the meantime, Viola's twin brother, Sebastian, is goign to London and needs someone to cover for him at school. Viola seized this oppurtunity and went to play on the boy's soccer team at her brother's school, pretending to be her twin brother the whole time. Sorry, I can't tell you the rest because it would spoil the excitement of seeing the movie for the first time.</comment>

    <title>a best one</title>
    <comment>this is my girlfriends favorite thing to watch; she thinks it's hilarious. i don't enjoy it as much as her, but i still think it has some very funny bits. if you're a fan of the show definitely buy it. if you've never seen the show it's likely you'll laugh, so buy it if you have the spare money.</comment>

    <title>the best of all the six movies</title>
    <comment>"Revenge of the Sith" would be the most important event in the Star Wars story. Here, we see how Anakin Skywalker turned into the Dark Side and we also see how he transformed into the "man in the suit", the Evil Darth Vader. Thanks to George lucas because he really put here the great ending of the whole six movies. For me, I'm happy that I purchased the last one and I'm thankful about it.</comment>

    <title>Barbie as the Island Princess</title>
    <comment>I found that this movie is more about learning about Barbie and her life then just the good vs. evil as most of them are. It does have a "bad guy" but not so scary and better than some other movies for the younger ones. I love the music and singing! Great movie!</comment>

    <title>Best Game I've Bought Yet</title>
    <comment>This game has been the best game I have bought for the PSP yet. I have always liked the Syphon Filter games. I really enjoyed the PS1 games. This game has the best graphics of any other PSP game I have ever played. I think the storyline was great. It did end a little open but that is good because it left room for the next game, (which I cannot wait to purchase.) In the end, this game is a great purchase and anyone with a PSP should buy it just to experience the graphics and the thrill of the game. Way to go Sony!!!!</comment>

    <comment>One of the best shows on air. Beautifully done, one of the best stop frame and clay animation shows to ever exist. One of the few shows that dares to challenge religion. Now that being said, the show is respectful, I think, and extremely effective. The show is all fun and not meant to hurt anyone.</comment>

    <title>A MUST-HAVE!!!!</title>
    <comment>This has got to be one of the best South Park seasons out there because it has some of the funniest episodes on it. Such as the World of Warcraft, ManBearPig, The Dog Whisperer, and many others. Sure like all seasons there 1 or 2 episodes that aren't that great but overall it's extremely hilarious. If you are a fan of South Park this is a must for all of you.</comment>

    <title>Terrible Movie!!!!</title>
    <comment>This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life, it had a dumb storyline and there wasn't many zombies. They never really went after the zombies either, they just ran away from them the entire movie. If you make a zombie movie, you have to make a lot more gorier and violent to be an amazing zombie unlike Dawn of the Dead which was incredible. If you're looking for a good zombie movie don't watch this, you'll just waste your time. Although, the sequel to this (28 Weeks Later) doesn't look that bad. Since it comes out tomorrow I might have to go rent it to see if it's any good.</comment>

    <title>Best game for 360</title>
    <comment>This is a game that should be bought for the 360. This is a game you want to buy if you like online games and shooters. Beautiful graphics, good detail and fantastic storyline make this game a must get. Not only is there a good storyline and excellent multiplayer, but there is also a new feature that lets you modify maps and add objects to existing maps. This game online is spectacular.</comment>

    <title>Sick Movies!!!</title>
    <comment>These movies are actually really good I never really paid attention to them until one of my friends recommended it to me. I'm so happy he recommended it to me because I love these movies. The only little downside to it is that the first one looks kinda cheesy because of the monster thing in it and that's it. Overall these movies are incredible and costs really cheap with a free movie ticket to the third one as well.</comment>

    <title>Good product</title>
    <comment>I recently purchased an HDTV and I don't have cable or satellite. The regular antenna I had been using for my old non HD tv had worked just fine for that old tv, but it was not giving me clear reception on many of the channels with the HDTV set. I also have many trees around my house and on windy days the reception would be even worse on the HDTV. I purchased the RCA HD antenna and most of the channels now come in much clearer and remain clear, even when the wind blows through the trees. Though there are still a couple of channels that are a bit fuzzy. This product seems to work pretty good for me, and the price is very reasonable. I would recommend this product to others.</comment>

    <title>More Movies Should Be Like This</title>
    <comment>An "Evening" of Poetic Style - A star-studded film that is almost like watching a poem. It is the moving story of a dying woman (played brilliantly by Vanessa Redgrave) whose life took many pivitol turns during one fateful summer day in the 1950s (outstandingly played by Claire Danes). It reveals that we may all look back and remember regrets and mistakes, but also hold on to the love of family and friendships.</comment>

    <comment>I remember seeing this aired only once Paul Lynde Halloween Special on ABC in October 1976 (prempting for a week the Donny and Marie Show, though Donny and Marie Osmond made a surprise cameo in the "Kids" number). The main features in the special are the meeting of Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West and Billie Hayes as Witchiepoo, as well as the few songs performed by rock group KISS.</comment>

    <title>Safest Purchase Ever</title>
    <comment>Another wonderful product from the guys at Monster. This particular device should be the center of all home theater displays. Not only does it protect every product connected to it from power surge, it also filters cable lines, internet lines, and phone lines to ensure that all products connected are functioning at top potential. Moster professionals also have a guarantee on this product whic claims they will replace up to $350,000 worth of equipement if their product fails to protect them from a power surge. This provides all Monster consumers with the safety of knowing their product will last. Argueably the best feature is the alarm that sounds when the power center detects a surge. This alarm engages the auto disengage feature which disconnects each plug from the power source to prevent a surge. All in all, this product is a MUST for any home theater system. It gives every customer the peace of mind to know that their equipment is protected by the monster power center.</comment>

You won't want to stop and you'll probably lose some amount of sleep over this. Enjoy this series with some friends ... it's more fun.</comment>

    <comment>I only gave this a 4 out of 5 because you have to like this type of music to like this CD. If you know of the Chariot, then you most likely know their music, and it is ever better then their first cd. This is a MUST BUY for any hard rock fan, but if you are not familiar with their music, listen to some of their songs before you get this album.</comment>

    <title>MUST BUY!!!!!!</title>
    <comment>If you like DC Talk, pop, Christian music, rap, or just about any other type of music, then TobyMac is your guy! This CD is PERFECT with every song he does. This man is a very talented artist, and you can tell by his music he is truly Blessed by God. This is a must buy for anyone that considers themselves a Christian music fan, or any music fan for that matter! God Bless!</comment>

    <title>Season 2 Is Quite Amazing</title>
    <comment>House is one of my favorite TV shows and I love being able to own the each season on DVD to be able to watch at any time. The very last episode of this season (2) is quite possibly my all time favorite episode. New twists in this season. The season was another amazing season. I enjoy the disc layout and the one sided discs over the two sided discs of season 1. One thing I miss is the short synopsis of each episode in the Episode Index on each DVD from the Season 1 DVDs. It made it easier to figure out which episode I wanted to watch once I had one of the DVDs in. Quality seems great, haven't had any problems with the discs. Overall, it is great. For all those House fans, it is a must buy.</comment>

    <comment>This movie was such an eye opening on how some people thought. How you could really change your life around. A lot of people believe in peer pressure and this character over came all of that and thought for him self. Found that his family came first. I recommend for parents to show this movie to thier kids and it will give them an insite of another persons mind.</comment>

    <comment>I am a middle school science teacher and my students all have a blast watching the mythbusters. I use this to teach students the scientific method as the mythbusters are really good at explaining every bit of detail on how their mythbusting experiments go. I definitely recommend this to other science teachers and also for the casual viewer who just want a good laugh!</comment>

    <title>Offbeat Fun</title>
    <comment>Dame Judi Dench is fabulous, as usual. Great to see Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) again, this time, speaking in his own English accent. I empathized with Mrs. Henderson, a recent widow, who wants to reinvent herself. She founds a theatre with 24-hour shows. When others copy that, she adds naked women. It's bawdy good fun and reveals her heart-warming secret at the end.</comment>

    <title>Great DVD Release!</title>
    <comment>If you're a horror fan, than this is probably not the movie for you. But if you like movies with all the elements of a cult classic, than you have to see this. There's demons running all over and a little wolf child and some people may call the special effects cheesy. But it does make for one entertaining movie. And the extras are phenomenal. The case is pretty flashy too. I think the cover alone pretty much describes the whole movie.</comment>

    <title>Best Show In A While</title>
    <comment>This show absolutely blew me away the first time I saw it. It was so awesome. Each episode got better and better. Everything about it was amazing. The story line was so uniquely written. I was so disappointed when NBC quit airing The Black Donnellys but I continued to watch on NBC.com. I was even more disappointment when I found out this was it for The Black Donnellys, it would not be back for a second season. This season will absolutely blow you away and leave you wanting more and make you ask NBC "why". Amazing is all I can say. Just watch for yourself.</comment>

    <title>Could have been much better</title>
    <comment>As a fan of the TV show, I was expecting more from this movie, but it did not deliver. I felt that the movie dragged on for too long. It felt like they put the same amount of jokes and humor that is found in a 30 minute episode into nearly 90 minutes. The result is too few laughs in too much time. If you want a good laugh from the Reno sheriff's department, watch the show, not this movie.</comment>

    <title>Great Perfomance and Value</title>
    <comment>There really isn't a whole lot of detail needed for this device. Rocketfish had made an affordable device that does exactly what it says. I have this hooked to my Samsung HT-AS720 and it works flawlessly. You would think it was designed for it. It has its own adjustable volume, and its size and range makes it convenient to place almost anywhere, even another room. My only complaint is that it does not have a remote or an IR sensor, so unless you leave it on, you have to manually turn on/off both pieces of the receiver for use each time. Luckily it is a low-power consuming item. Great product overall, though. I highly recommend it!!</comment>

    <title>Almost Best Down Ever</title>
    <comment>Down is a band made up of a few different rockers from other bands. Phil from Pantera, Pepper from Corrosion of Conformity just to start. Down is Phils best work. His singing is great. Losing All is my favorite track, followed by a softly sung Jail. Down does a great job of mixing the music up making it hard on sec, to blues-y the next. This break in style keeps it interesting. Down's next album Down II takes this foundation and builds on it with great success. If your a fan of the hard stuff and want some more substance, check out DOWN.</comment>

    <title>Best Movie You'll Read This Year</title>
    <comment>If you are an ADULT fan of fantasy then don't let this film go under your radar simply because it is subtitled. Many a supposed "movie-lover" have passed on films just because they have to read the sub-titles. Don't do it - trust me. This is an ADULT fairy-tale filled with magic and meanness. Inhuman creatures and human monsters. And a little girl who realizes she needs to escape the harsh world she is in and return to the land where she is princess. This movie WILL NOT let you down. The Special Edition DVD is filled with so many behind the scenes extras that you can remain in the world Pan's Labyrinth creates long after the movie itself is over. Extra tidbit: This movie was made as a companion piece to an earlier Guillermo del Toro movie The Devil's Backbone.</comment>

    <title>Great DVD</title>
    <comment>I think Disney has found them another great hit! I like the fact that I don't have to wonder about this show if it's going to be too much for my kids to watch. So many of today's shows are to mature for kids, but they put them out there and advertise them like they are for children when in reality, they're not. Hannah Montana is good for both boys and girls. I have both and they love this DVD!</comment>

    <title>Amazing Police Drama</title>
    <comment>If you're looking for an amazing police drama, look no further than Akira Kurosawa's Stray Dog. Following a rookie detective whose gun gets stolen by a pickpocket in post-WWII Tokyo, Stray Dog offers a solid story replete with masterfully-crafted suspense. In addition to the awesome movie, you get a slew of bonus features. A 32-minute documentary on the making of Stray Dog fills you in on the history of the project. A full-length commentary track by Stephen Prince, a well-respected Kurosawa historian, dissects the movie and its place in Japanese history and society. It's always educational, but Prince's academic tone can become a bit dry at points. The subtitle translation is perfect, and the image quality is gorgeous, but what do you expect, it's a Criterion release. In addition, it comes with a printed booklet featuring essays by Terrence Rafferty and Akira Kurosawa himself. If you're in the mood for a great early noir and feel like watching a master at work, you couldn't go wrong with Stray Dog.</comment>

    <comment>This was a great action movie that actually had decent actors for a change. I thought this movie was going to be a bit cheesy but they did a great job in keeping it realistic enough to almost be believed. Story was alright and the whole movie had a good flow without much downtime.</comment>

    <title>Very Good Movie</title>
    <comment>If you like Adam Sandler, especially in a movie like Click then you'll love this movie. It's a little darker or almost an independant type flick, which I usually don't care for, but I thought this movie was excellant. Funny, sad, encouraging, just overall very good. Great supporting cast like said in other reviews. I love every movie by Adam Sandler, I think personally his acting gets better and better in every movie he's in.</comment>

    <title>Buy It</title>
    <comment>BSSM is by far the Chili Pepper's greatest album to date. It shows them in their prime in the early 1990's when they are just about to make it bigger than life. THe way each song has it's own unique and amazing sound is just down right impresive. I love this CD and think that any one who love the Red Hot CHili Pepers should go out andbuy it right now.</comment>

    <title>Great popcorn Flick</title>
    <comment>This movie didn't do all that well in the box office, unfortunately every movie lives or dies by its opening weekend! The premise of the movie is very interesting. We have a guy who can see up to two minutes into the future at any given time. Almost as a perpetual deja vu everything is familiar, he knows the outcome of any event he is involved in and can make changes to obscure the results. However the only downfall the movie has is it didn't play off of some of the more interesting aspects of his gift. At one point in the movie he says hes going to search the building for bombs. At that point it shows him making hundreds of decisions at the same time resulting in different outcomes. Within two minutes he saw 100 different futures based on what choices he made at any given time. They could have easily made the main character this extreme entity that would put any comic book Hero to shame. Instead they make him out to be a standard guy who just seems to be very lucky. Thats where the movie failed because for him, luck does not exist; he can control his fate, show that to the extreme, dont try and make it more believable. All in all it was a very entertaining movie that should allow the mind to wonder about what that ability could do for yourself. At the same token with only being able to see 2 minutes into the future it doesn't show how one mistake given enough time could be the greatest move of your life.</comment>

    <title>Extreme even if it does not say so</title>
    <comment>I have been using this guy for more than a year now Closer to 2 i think. I spend a lot of time in the great outdoors, and up in Northern Minnesota, that can cary a lot of weight. I spent more than 4 hours out in -25F (yes that's below 0)temperatures one day, and even though the card is not rated below freezing, it did its job without complaining. I captured some of the best images of my life that day, and the card survived to show me them that evening. I recently purchased an Extreme III 4gb card, and I cannot tell a speed difference or any other difference.. Well made and has been trouble free!</comment>

    <title>Great story, Intense online action</title>
    <comment>The team at Bungie has really stepped it up in this third installment of Halo without trying to overdo it. The campaign mode is fun and made even more so by allowing online co-op. You can actually play the campaign with friends over the Internet. Multiplayer is a blast too. But Bungie has made it more fun by adding the Theater mode. This is where you can watch back any of your gaming sessions, both campaign and multiplayer. You can follow yourself, other players, or even detach the camera and free roam the map. It adds hours and hours more fun to the game. And you can even learn from your mistakes.</comment>

    <title>Great MJ DVD</title>
    <comment>This is a nice Michael Jackson compilation DVD, which includes many of his major hits. I was only looking for one in particular, but I got many more as an added bonus. I would recommend this DVD for any MJ fan who wants to remember him as a great musician, dancer and videomaker. It's a nice DVD to have in your collection.</comment>

    <title>The Fun of a Carnival without the crowd and food</title>
    <comment>If you like carnival type games, then Carnival Games is for you! You start off by defining a character (there are slots for more than 4, so your friends can have their own profile) that you can dress and add accessories to. This is important later as many of the in-game earnable/unlockable items are things you can have your character wear. There's a wide offering of games, including my favorite, Day at the Races. My only gripes are that the instructions are lacking on some games and the coin pusher game cheats you if the coins fall too early! A practice mode like in Mario Party would've been nice. Doing well in games earns you both tickets and prizes (except for unlockable 'super' games which just earn your high score records). Just like at a real carnival, you can trade smaller prizes up for larger prizes.</comment>

    <title>Awesome Game! So Much Fun!</title>
    <comment>I just recently grabbed a copy of this game, and all I want to do is play it! It is really more fun than you know! (if you havent played the DS version or this one that is) From the minute you turn on the game, the fun begins. You are quickly briefed about certain tools and procedures by supporting characters in the game. It then goes right into your operations. The first 3 are basically set up as training stages. But unlike some games trainings, these are actually really fun. Your nurse leaves after stage 3, and by then you need to know what tools to use and when. You will cut patients open, do all your operating (while making sure your patients vitals dont drop, because that could be fatal) and then sew them back up and send them on their way! You choose either from 3 difficulty levels, easy medium and hard for each operation, so you can always go back and challenge yourself over and over again. You are graded after each procedure, and if your like me, you will want to improve your grade each time! This game utilizes the wii-mote so well! You need to hold steady while making incisions, cutting with the scalpel, and removing items from the body. Keeping a steady hand is key. This is not your ordinary mindless game, it really gets you into what needs to be done and keeps your attention the whole way through. If you are looking for a fun one player game, GET THIS ONE! Its just what the doctor ordered!</comment>

    <title>It is a good movie that is close to the book</title>
    <comment>If you haven't read the book it starts as our hero Eragon dreaming of some one (will be named later) who is running from a dark wizard. Later while hunting through the forest Eragon finds a big blue stone and takes it. Later the stone hatches and a little blue baby girl dragon comes out. She grows up after a little while as Eragon finds out about Dragon Riders. Not long after Saphira grows to full leangth Eragon's uncle is killed and he is taken by a "town drunk" who turns out to know more about dragons then he let on. While on their path to find the last of the Varden (people who faught aginst the king) they deal with Razacs, and the kings forces as well as find the woman who Eragon was dreaming about. Its a good movie but some of the goofs are painfuly obvious, but that is what makes some movies so unforgetable</comment>

    <title>Awesome...rental</title>
    <comment>At Worlds End is the quintessential rental. Its not that the game is bad, just not really worth buying. Graphics: Most of the graphics are fine. Not really taking full of advantage of the 360 engine though. The model of Jack and Barbosa are perfect, the rest of the cast are ok, except for Elizabeth, who looks nothing like Kiera Knightley. Sound/Music, Besides the theme song from the movie, the music was ok for the game. Nothing spectacular, but not irritating. The sound effects are the same. Gameplay: The mechanics are easy to learn and the tutorial level is pretty entertaining. The movements are your basic fighting techniques common in adventure games with the occassional combo move thrown in. The dueling is nice, but very simple. Replayability: Limited replayability. Worth going back for a bit just unlock some achievements or to get a higher notoriety for bragging rights. Besides that, once you're done, you're done. Overall, this game makes a great rental. But unless you're a diehard Depp/Pirates fan, not really worth keeping.</comment>

    <comment>It starts as Hellboy is just getting back from a mission and now has to go out again and investigate ghosts in a house that are starting to become mad. Hellboy and the others quickly find out that their is more to the place then meets the eye when they start finding blood and warnings. All in all its a good short movie with vampires and lots of fighting.</comment>

    <title>Funniest Man on DVD!</title>
    <comment>John Pinette is side-splitting hilarious to watch! He takes on issues we all see every day but can't say anything about - well John says it for us! His view on people who "browse" the menu at McDonalds is hilarious. This is the latest in his DVD releases, and the absolute funniest I think! Watch this DVD - you'll be quoting him for weeks!</comment>

    <title>Inexpensive for gym</title>
    <comment>I buy these headphones regularly because they keep the sweat out of ears while using my MP3 during workouts and they stay in place. They provide ok sound and don't take up much space. For ordinary use I use another set of earphones that have better response and keep out ambient noise. The earphones have an L-shaped connector that keeps them from being accidentally pulled out of the jack. Unfortunately the wire at this point weakens over time and will disrupt the connection, far more rapidly than other headphones and well before other parts wear out. This is offset by the price. At $9.99 this is a good buy for headphones that last about one year the way I use them. At $12.99 I'd look around for something else. Above that I wouldn't consider it.</comment>

    <comment>I brought this speaker half year ago and i love this speaker. The sound quality is very good and it is a good choice for budget customer. The design is good too and it looks very nice and sleek on my desk. However, there is one thing i do not like about it. It has no power switch. I can not shut it down unless I unplug it. I have to leave it open all the time but that waste energy.</comment>

    <title>Great Memories</title>
    <comment>I watched this movie for the first time with my grandma when I was a little girl. I have been waiting for it to come out on DVD so I could have it to watch and think of those great memories. I hope my kids will enjoy it as much as I did when I was little. I remember the cute story that is great for even kids to watch. I also remember all the great music in the movie. I'm thinking of getting the CD. I think this is a great family movie that especially those that love musicals will enjoy for years to come!</comment>

    <title>Light on plot but lots of action</title>
    <comment>I'll admit I'm not a huge action movie fan but I like movies that explore how changing one action changes future outcomes. I am a fan of Nicholas Cage so when I saw the previews I really wanted to see the movie but was disappointed with the plot that seemed to suffer in deference to more action scenes. There were what I considered huge holes in plot and the ending left one saying "What?!??" at the end of the movie. I think that was the point but it was disappointing.</comment>

    <title>Best show ever cancelled</title>
    <comment>It usually takes great shows a little time to find their sea legs. Characters are raw and undeveloped, actors aren't quite getting the kind of direction they'll get a season or two down the road, writers a little uncertain where they're going so they leave themselves some wiggle room. Not so with Arrested Development. From the Pilot on it delivers hilarious lines, a consistent yet developing chemistry between characters, and as much consistency in writing as you can expect from a show that isn't especially plot-based. Micheal (Jason Bateman) works for his father at a housing development company named after the family: The Bluth Company. His siblings are ne'er-do-well's who have never worked in their lives and still pick up company paychecks. When his father is arrested (are you starting to see where the name came from?) for reasons that remain vague during the first season, and the company falls apart, Micheal steps in to keep it, and the family together. George Micheal, his son, is his conscience and the person who convinces him that his family is worth keeping around. His sister is generally smarter than the rest of the family, but hides it behind her vanity most of the time while she struggles to make her marriage to her clueless husband work. Her clueless husband is therapist turned actor with a knack for Freudian slips. His brother JOB is a magician whose own Magicians Alliance has black-listed him from working in the industry because he gave away a trick in a hopeless effort to win his father's affection. Buster is a momma's boy to a mother who barely qualifies as a mother. Together, they're the most dysfunctional family ever. What really makes the show work are the individual scenes. Lines are delivered and countered with gut-splitting comedic timing and clever writing that isn't normally found in the sitcom genre. It's not a family friendly show, content (almost entirely in the form of dialogue) is often pushing the boundaries of what censors will allow, but usually what comes to the screen is more subtle than other sitcoms as well. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor, and buy this show.</comment>

    <title>Best Game Ever</title>
    <comment>I didn't think you could improve upon perfection but Bungie has done just that. One of the only reasons I bought an XBOX in the first place was to play Halo and now with Halo 3 it just justifies the reason I also got an XBOX 360.</comment>

    <title>Hiro!</title>
    <comment>I started watching the first season as soon as it came out on dvd. Boy am I glad I finished it in time for Season 2! I absolutely fell in love with the characters, especially Hiro. The special effects are very cool, and I can imagine they would look great in High-def. Highly recommended!</comment>

    <title>no more waiting...</title>
    <comment>Waiting is the definition of dirty humor. It is very similar to that of Wedding Crashers or Bachelor Party (for you old school comedy lovers!) Ryan Reynolds is almost the exact same type of character he played in Van Wilder but this time he has a supporting crew that are much more funny themselves and make for one great watch. The plot is simply a day in the life of a new guy at the restaurant Shananaganz. Overall, amazing funny, probably my favorite of all time, i recommend it to everyone that can take a joke and crude humor.</comment>

    <comment>Definatly a great buy! I was very anxious for it to come out, after hearing the pretender. The album is definatly a little more mellow than I had hoped but it works for them. The song " Stranger things have happened before" is my favorite song on there but I was very impressed with the whole album.</comment>

    <title>MUST OWN for JT fans!</title>
    <comment>This dvd is amazing. James Taylor opens this show with "Everyday", which he sings beautifuuly and the show just gets better from there. There are lots of his greatest hits on here that are wonderful, but my favorites include the Pull Over performance of "Junkie's Lament" and "You Can Close Your Eyes". This dvd would be great for both the JT lite fan (greatest hits lovers) and for the true blue James Tylor fan that can name all of his studio albums in chronological order. :) I play this dvd so often- sometimes when I am in the next room sewing or cleaning and it's a nice mixture of songs to hear. Buy it! You'll love it.</comment>

    <comment>This program has many useful features that are useful in creating documents and publications. The smartshapes feature is AWESOME! It makes making charts fun ... oddly enough to say :) The only downside is that all the options are in a different place, just a little more time to find. (Also make sure you don't need Microsoft Outlook because it isn't included in this package.)</comment>

    <title>Another Great Tyler Perry Movie</title>
    <comment>This movie has a solid cast with good acting. I enjoy Tyler Perry movies for the quality and a good message, this movie is no exception. There are too many movies that depict stereotypical no good fathers, but this movie gives kudos to the good fathers like Monty,Idris Elba's character, who care about their kids. Gabrielle Union is as witty and beautiful as she always is, and overall this movie is worth watching again and again!</comment>

    <title>Greatest Horror Film of All Time</title>
    <comment>This classic horror film uses suspense and the fear of the unknown to scare the audience. Not a lot of blood and gore, which in my opinion is not scary. I watch this movie every year at Halloween, it never gets old!</comment>

    <title>Perfect Collection</title>
    <comment>i've got the whole GTA collection from GTA on the PS-GTA:San Andreas on the PS2 even own them all on the PC..lol love GTA great games and yet another one to go in to my collection of maps and game guides! Pros 1.Awasome story lines 2.Kill whoever you want...just dont get caught 3.Well worth the money for the game...will keep you playing well after you've completed the game. Cons 1. Not suitable for kids under 12-13 because of excessive violance, Prostitution, Drugs/Alchol referances. Not really something you want a growing child to be around. 2.Has alot of cussing and racial referances. Also not something you want a growing child to go to school and repeat words. hope this is helpfull...</comment>

    <title>Great Buy!!!</title>
    <comment>I MUST SAY, FOR THE MONEY YOU PAY FOR THESE SPEAKERS, YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM. THEY HAVE GREAT SOUND, A TON OF POWER, AND GOOD BASS. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN FIND A PAIR OF SPEAKERS LIKE THESE FOR $80. THE SAME TYPE SPEAKER FROM ANOTHER BRAND WILL PROBABLY COST UPWARDS OF $200. THERE ARE BETTER SPEAKERS OUT THERE, BUT FOR THE PRICE, THESE ARE THE BEST. I MATCHED THESE UP WITH THE SMALLER BOOKSHELFS (for surrounds), THE CENTER CHANNEL, 12" SUB AND THE STR-DG810 RECEIVER AND I AM LOVING THE RESULTS. MY HOME THEATRE HAS NOT SOUNDED BETTER AND I DIDN'T PAY A TON OF MONEY FOR THE SET-UP.</comment>

    <title>Not very good for Win XP</title>
    <comment>If you are not running VISTA and/or do not have a floppy drive do not buy this or any other SATA drive. Because SATA wasnt completed when XP came out you have to load the OEM drivers on via a floppy disk. Considering they dont make floppy drives anymore, its quite the headache. It was easy to install in my computer, but you cannot partition the drive until the drivers are installed. Of course, there is no mention of this anywhere on the box, in the advertising, etc. But Geek Squad will charge $199 to do it for you.</comment>

    <title>Excellent game</title>
    <comment>I played Halo 2 on system link and splitscreen almost everyday for probably over two years, no other game I've ever played stayed fun for that long. Now that Halo 3 is out, I'm sure that it will be a permanent replacement. I played through the single player of Halo 2 only once, but the Halo 3 single player is a lot more fun, especially with co-op mode (online!). Since I play mainly on system link and splitscreen, I can easily say that the interface is much improved for the most part, like the ability to join a splitscreen game that is in progress. Although there are some annoying issues now when a player playing with others on the same 360 needs to change their controller settings and goes into the pause menu and it disrupts every player on the screen (This is especially annoying during system link and live games where the game is still going on but every player on that 360 can't move, shoot or even see but they can hear and feel themselves getting killed). All in all, a small price to pay for an excellent game that will be fun for a long time to come!</comment>

    <comment>Alias is edge of your seat action and it leaves you wanting more. At the end of this box set, I could hardly wait to start the disc to the next season. J.J. Abrams is a genius!! And Jennifer Garner is an amazingly versatile actress. If you love action, adventure and mystery, this is definately for you.</comment>

    <title>Solid Purchase</title>
    <comment>I am very happy with this product. I previously had a Lynksys speedbooster G series router that lost connectivity with my internet service several times a week. Since I upgraded, connectivity is no longer an issue. My house is a long house, so I find that the range is not as good as I expected per the advertising on the box.</comment>

    <title>Best Game Ever</title>
    <comment>this was the best fps game i have ever played. the campaign mode is as in depth as any other game ever created. One thing that was even better was the amazing online play. I recommended it to everyone.</comment>

    <title>Dissapointing, but still fun!</title>
    <comment>This is an O.K. game. In this game, you have new ways of winning. You do not have landing on stars, in some maps, you have to make a real estate, and you get stars for that, I got the best tactics that always make you win. I beat the storyline in about 1 hour. The only thing that dissaponted me was that you DO NOT get to play a minigame every turn. Overall, I would give this game a 3. It is worth $35, not $50.</comment>

    <title>OK family movie</title>
    <comment>This is an ok family/kids movie to watch. It has a lot of funny moments to keep both young and old entertained. But for an older audience, the story line is predictable and even annoying at times. Also it is not really a role that Ice Cube plays well. Its an ok movie and good for some laughs.</comment>

    <title>Best Halo By Far</title>
    <comment>Make no mistake, Halo 3 is the best Halo ever. Not only are the graphics worlds better than in previous installments, the game play and epic scale is unsurpassed. It definitely still feels like Halo, and the graphics aren't as good looking as something like Bioshock, but the seamless check points, minimal loading, and fantastic screen and video capture features put this first person shooter over the top. The game is definitely a showcase for the Xbox 360 and should be purchased and played by all, regardless of your interest in first person shooters. Like Halo 1 and 2 before it, Halo 3 not only has FPS action, but also numerous vehicles which are controlled via a 3rd person perspective, and some weapons are also used from a pseudo 3rd person perspective. All gaming sessions can be watched in the Halo 3 theater, and in there you can detach the video camera, stop and start the action, fast forward, capture screen shots, and for non-campaign sessions, even save edited video clips. It is a very robust tool that in and of itself can provide countless hours of fun. When you throw multiplayer into the mix, Halo 3 is an amazing game well worth the asking price and one that you will undoubtedly play more than once. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Songs to send chills up your spine</title>
    <comment>This CD turned me into a hardcore Foo Fighters fan. I loved everyone of their singles so I decided to make a leap for it and buy one of their albums. As soon as I purchased it, I popped it into my CD player for the ride home. I have never been more satisfied about a CD purchase. I've listened to it so many times. My passengers got tired of it before I did. haha. Every song is beautiful. My fav songs: all of them.</comment>

    <title>Great Game</title>
    <comment>As you could expect, Halo 3 is an outstanding game. The graphics are great, The online play is as good as ever, and the story mode actually finishes the story.Although the game is pretty much the same style as the previous game, it still never gets old. New weapons like the spikers and laser charger give you a chance to think of a new game plan. With 4 difficulty levels one the story, it gives you a bunch of opportunities to perfect your game. The best difficulty level id Hero, though.</comment>

    <title>Another great season</title>
    <comment>In this exciting season of DBZ, the heroes of Earth go to the planet Namek to obtain a new set of dragonballs so that they can wish their friends back to life. Unfortunately, the Earthlings are not the only ones in the pursuit. Vegeta recuperates and tries to collect the balls as well as Frieza, the horrible space tyrant. This is probably the most exciting and dramatic season of DBZ because there is a new development every show that is essential to what is going on in the story. I love the layout of the DVD's in the case, because it's not always easy to package 6 discs in one bundle so conveniently. There are no drawbacks to this season whatsoever.</comment>

    <comment>This is probably the best Foo Fighters album since "The Colour and the Shape" and quite possibly the best rock album of the year. Usually, the last few tracks of most albums are lackluster. "Echoes" packs a punch all the way through. You definitely get your money's worth with this one. And for those who were disappointed with "In Your Honor," won't be this time.</comment>

    <title>I Didn't Think I'd Like It</title>
    <comment>After all, it's main character has quite a unique passion, and it's not at all socially acceptable. Truthfully I was sure that I was going to hate the Series, it's not too hard to read about serial killers in a novel. After all it's only a novel, not real. But when it gets put into the visual medium it can start to get iffy. All that said, I loved the show. They put up a tightrope to walk across, and instead of walking, they shot across it on a motorcycle. They managed to make me like Dexter in spite of his non-standard profession.</comment>

    <title>Best Purchase I have ever made</title>
    <comment>I bought this game and I fell in love with it. It was amazing and I totally recommend it to anyone who is an 80s child or loves the music. I also recommend it to people who are coordinated especially with guitar, if you are not it will definitely make you become coordinated. I did not dislike anything about this product at all. Im sure there is probably a flaw somewhere as well as all products but I haven't seen one yet. This game is like Dance Dance Revolution but using your fingers, while listening to the amazing jams from that beautiful decade.</comment>

    <title>Great game with friends</title>
    <comment>I love this game and have a wonderful time playing with friends. This games is ridiculously hard on a solo mission! haha. I admit I have never played Halo before this game but for a beginner the normal mode which is the minimal to get acheivements is really tough. Almost too tough. But for Halo fans like my friends they LOVE it and I love playing it with them so they can help me out on missions haha. Great game overall.</comment>

    <title>Funny Movie!</title>
    <comment>Okay, so this movie isn't very deep, but if you're looking for some mindless fun this could be the movie for you. Orlando Jones is funny in any movie. There's also a priceless shot of David Duchovny's rear end when he moons another character.</comment>

    <title>Enthralling</title>
    <comment>I love this movie even though I'm actually very conservative. There is just something in the narrative that grabs you. The movie is action packed, but the action is good that is there. They get the meaning across, and the locations are cryptic and memorizing. If you want a movie that'll make you think, get this one.</comment>

    <title>sci-fi/action movie</title>
    <comment>Total Recall is still one of the best sci-fi movies that I have ever seen and its still holds up to today's standards. Its has a great plot and probably the best soundtrack ever made. If you like Schwarzenegger movies you will like Total Recall.</comment>

    <title>Ben Harper is Genius</title>
    <comment>I have never heard a song by Ben Harper that wasn't good, and this cd definitely added to that. I'm so glad Ben went back into the studio with the entire band this time, and it really shows on the cd: the music seems a lot deeper and fuller. Lyrics are amazing, and I love the addition of so much piano/keyboard by Jason Yates. Having Wings is definitely one of my favorite Ben Harper songs ever, and the acoustic/instrumental track, Paris Sunrise, is outstanding. Gotta love Ben and his acoustic slide guitar. Get this cd, it is AMAZING!</comment>

    <title>The 7th Voyage of Sinbad</title>
    <comment>The 7th Voyage of Sinbad is my all time favorite. Advanturous Story yet fills with part romance genre. I like everything about it, from the plot, settings, charaters and to the costumes. Even though the plot is simple and the usual Hero saves the Day and his Love type. However, It is still one of the greatest Sinbad movie ever made. Only misfortune would the graphic and special effects. A bit of too unrealist Overall, It is a wonderful and worth recommending to anyone who is into old time island treasure advanture fantasy.</comment>

    <title>Sci-Fi Fanatics</title>
    <comment>Twilight Zone the movie is finally here. I've been looking forward to this for some time now. Digitally restored bringing this eighties classic sci-fi back to life. Based upon the television series by rod serling who brought you into another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind. I don't think that I have to tell you to go and get this. Your probably on your way right now.</comment>

    <title>So-so</title>
    <comment>This movie was a let down after the first one was so good. Despite being set in Britain this film was very Americanized. They attempted to create a plot that really didn't hit home and came across as contrived. On the other hand, it might be worth seeing in case they come out with a third one that is more like the first.</comment>

    <title>ALMOST PERFECT</title>
    <comment>A great improvement over the white plastic keyboard on the previous iMac. The low travel makes typing a breeze for touch typists, and the keys require just enough pressure so that you don't accidentally press any of them. The USB ports shouldbe on the back of it though, where they were located on the white plastic keyboard. As it is, they're under the keyboard, so to plug something in or out, you have to lift up the whole keyboard.</comment>

    <title>Terrific action movie of summer</title>
    <comment>This movie had great special effects offered. I thought that towards the end of the movie it could have added a little more to the storyline to sum it up. I am sure the 3rd film (which is being developed now) will explain the end of the 2nd one more thoroughly. I would suggest this movie if you enjoy any of the comic book movies like superman, spiderman and x-men. There is no bad language, just crude humor. That's why the rating is PG. This is a great film which will keep your mind and nerves following every step of te way.</comment>

    <title>Best Purchase Ever</title>
    <comment>I thought the movie was utterly hilarious. The characters are such great stereotypes that everyone would laugh when they watch this movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone that I know, no matter who I was. I loved Adam Goldberg, the "Hebrew Hammer", he was a very well written character, well-played, and very well-dressed the entire movie. I especially loved the part where the Hammer and Esther went to the mall trying to act like goys and completely fail at it but they think they do great at it. I am going to watch this movie over and over again, I just cannot get enough of it!!!</comment>

    <title>Battles at SEA</title>
    <comment>Life on the open sea is rough; especially when your arch enemy is the French. Who knew that strategy's at sea was so complex. They do a very good job showing how different types of weather come into play. Smog, rain storms, and wind affect life at sea. The focus is pointed towards the chain-of-command. Without order there's chaos. Of course the men and boys who come from wealthy families are in control of the poor crew hands. You will be glad you live now and not back then.</comment>

    <comment>"227" became the "Good Times" and "The Hughleys" of the 1980s, airing on September 14, 1985, on NBC, "227" had starred Emmy-Award nominee Marla Gibbs, who recently shot to fame as Florence Johnston on "The Jeffersons", I am 12 years old, and basically the show had many successful stars: Mary Wilson, Angela Bassett, Kelsey Grammer, Sherman Hemsley, James Avery, The Temptations, Bobby Brown, Kim Fields, Nia Long and many more. "227" also starred Hal Williams ("Sanford &amp; Son" and "Private Benjamin") as Mary's husband/longtime contractor, Lester, Regina King ("A Thin Line Between Love and Hate", "Daddy Day Care" and "Poetic Justice") as teenaged daughter, Brenda, Helen Martin ("Good Times", "That's My Mama" and "Maude") as busybody Pearl who had a grandson named Calvin (Curtis Baldwin), who Brenda had a crush on. Alaina Reed Hall ("Cindy", and "Sesame Street") arrived to play Rose Lee Holloway, best friend of Mary and Pearl. Emmy-Award winner, Jackee Harry arrived to play Sexy vamp, Sandra Clark, who was always man-wise and very sexy towards men, this show was anything but average, but it changed the coloring face of television, and NBC aired the program from 1985 until 1990, for five hit seasons</comment>

    <title>Outstanding Last part of Sequal</title>
    <comment>When I first heard that this game was coming out, I thought that i would wait a few months after release because I am not a huge Halo 3 fan. But instead i saw it and I needed to buy it...so I did. I am amazed how many new things ubisoft (makers of game) had put in this game, all the new weapson, new maps, forge (create a map mode), and the intensity of the levels. If you, the reader, likes shooters and has played Halo 1 and/or 2, you must buy this game. I dont necesarily care about the Halo story but I love the gameplay, thats why I bought it. If you have never played any of the other halos, then this is the time to try it out. It is a lot of fun to play, and especially addictive. I could not stop playing until I beat it because I got stuck a few times, I had to spend hours on it. This game has exceptional graphics and astonishing gameplay that is extremely original. This is one of the best first person shooters for the XBOX 360 within in the past year, one of the best!!!! DEFENITE BUY! IF you are staring at this screen thinking if you should spend $60 on this game...you should...defenitely worth it.</comment>

    <title>Maybe the best concert film ever</title>
    <comment>An absolute joy to watch. It seems as fresh the tenth viewing as it does the first time you see it. This film does an amazing job of capturing one of the most influential bands of the New Wave era. The combination of David Byrne's artistic vision with Jonathan Demme's direction make it a must-see even if you only have a passing interest in Talking Heads music.</comment>

    <title>Halo 3</title>
    <comment>When i played Halo 3, it was one of the best gaming experiences of my life. Halo 3 to me, was a very fun game. I like this game because they have improved the weapons and utilized the use of online play with 4 player co-op online. The things i did not like about this game were that the story line was a little rough to follow and during co-op , it was annoying to have to retrace my steps throughout the game. Overall, i recommend this game and also recommend playing multi-player online.</comment>

    <comment>This TV stand is very nice. I have a 50" Plasma on it and the stand is more than sturdy to hold it. I have a receiver, a directv box, xbox, xbox360, vcr and a dvd player all in there with plenty of room. The cable management works very nice. I recommend this item!</comment>

    <title>History Chanel at it's Best</title>
    <comment>"Lost Worlds" is by far one of the best shows on television. This DVD brings all the early episodes together into one comprehensive set. What makes this show so great is that it doesn't just talk about the 'lost worlds,' it uses state of the art 3D technology to bring the ruined civilizations to their former glory. Unlike other shows of its kind, Lost Worlds goes beyond the mere engineering. The show presents the specific buildings and analyzes their strategic value, their cultural value, delves deep into the minds of those who built them to try to figure out why the structure was made. Overall a great buy for anyone who loves history, engineering, arcitecture, and many more.</comment>

    <title>Long Before Live Aid</title>
    <comment>When the Beatles created the first rock videos with their release of "Paperback Writer" and "Rain" were sent to Ed Sullivan to air in place of them actually appearing, a new medium was launched that in 1981 became MTV. When Ravi Shankar asked for George Harrison's help for a starving nation of then Bangladesh. George reacted by calling upon many of his friends in the music world to pitch in with the first Rock concert turned benefit concert for those less fortunate in Bangladesh. Long before Live Aid, Farm Aid, or Green Concerts. This was the one that started them all. The first two songs were rightly those of Ravi Shankar himself. You need not be a fan of Indian music to know it led to the World Beat craze years later. Then George Harrison does 3 songs, all of which come from his "All Things Must Pass" album. All of the songs were passionate readings of the originals. "Wah-Wah" especially sounds nice minus the "wall of sound" technic Phil Spector used on the original recording. Then George shares the spotlight with some of the other musicans who on a moments notice came to play without even being paid. Billy Preston and Ringo Starr give great performances, even with Ringo forgetting a few of the words to "It Don't Come Easy". The only performer that seems dated today is Leon Russell. George not known as a comfortable stage presence, does know how to pace a concert. The next big moment of the show was his and Eric Claptons performance of "While My Guitar Gently Weeps". Bigger surprises were still in store. George changes guitars, nervously looking off to the side of the stage, before calling out his surprise "Guest". George says, "I'd like to bring on a friend of us all, Mr. Bob Dylan." The crowd erupts in wild applause and amazement to George's announcement. George even up to the moment he looked off to his right of the stage, didn't know Bob would show. He hadn't been seen live in concert for 3 years. Bob sings 4 of his many classic songs, 1 of them from his "Blonde on Blonde" classic double disc and another from "Highway 61 Revisisted". George and Ringo back him up on guitar and tambourine throughout. The concert closes with George retaking the spotlight with "Something" and a great version of "Bangladesh". There are extras that hadn't seen the light of day since they were played that night. "If Not For You" duet by Bob and George. A soundcheck version of "Come on in my Kitchen" with George, Eric Clapton and Leon Russell. This concert should be seen by all. Especially by people my age who couldn't get tickets and had to read about it in the newspapers the next day. A true historic and magical concert experience.</comment>

    <comment>If you have Donnie's first album your sure to love this one and if you don't.. What are you waiting for? His music is inspiring and always has a message. I was turned on to him by a friend and would sure enough recommend him to any body who wants to here good music from a soul singer.</comment>

    <comment>My wife and I assembled it in about 30 minutes. Very simple assembly yet it is quite stable. It looks very classy with the Cherry wood legs and the dark smoked glass shelves and top. The rear center support doubles as a cable management device hidding all the connection wires giving you a nice clean look.</comment>

    <title>Good sound, but Cha-ching!</title>
    <comment>After getting my first audio receiver, speakers, and a Best Buy gift card I decided to cough up the extra bucks and get decent cables to connect the two. After a few hours of cutting, widdling, and twisting, everything was connected and set up. I'd say I am pleased with the sound quality coming through my speakers, but I often wonder if there would be a significant difference if I'd bought a lower grade (and cheaper) cable. The cable is also a bit heavy(after all it is good cable), so I'd recommend supporting the weight of the wire so that it doesn't pull out of your receiver and speakers.</comment>

    <comment>I shopped both circuit city and best buy for a great pair of speakers in this price range for my new receiver, and I love them. Great sound, I also bought a pair of stands and they were easy to set up and look great. Best buy by far had a better selection to choose from and expert help to answer all my questions.</comment>

    <comment>It has all the ingredients you need in a good movie. (Family, hero's, villains, blood, sweat, and tears.) The story plot works well with the characters. It has a great cast, music, and trauma. Let's not forget the fighting of Romans, barbarians, gladiators, and animals.</comment>

    <title>Excellent</title>
    <comment>This album is perhaps one of my very favorites. It's dancy and loud and the lyrics are amazing. Once you get past the accent (not hard) and the very British slang it's really easy to get into. Then again, those same things add to it, because it seems like a band you know, one you'd see in a pub on a Thursday night, but that are amazingly good. I highly recommend it!</comment>

    <comment>i feel this game is a 10/10 it has everything. xbox live makes it sooo much fun. now that you get ranked in xbox live it gives more incentive to play. i know the first day i got my copy i imedeatly played it. the downsides on live are unless your doing a custom game its all random the nice thing is you can stay with a good team of people</comment>

    <comment>I am a huge fan of Monk, and if you have never seen this show before I would highly recommend it. It is very entertaining and also intriguing. When I'm watching Monk I'll be trying to solve the mystery, laughing because of Monk's OCD, and also getting goosebumps because of what's happening. I absolutely love Monk and hope that you will understand. I highly recommend that you get this.</comment>

    <comment>They should have killed off the FF4 at the very beginning of the movie and left only Silver Surfer vs. Dr. Doom. Then it would have been 5 out of 5 stars. The characters are just so lame. I just hope they don't make another one.</comment>

    <title>Just Horrible</title>
    <comment>The move is horrible. It has cheep effects, a story that ignores the movies on which there based, acting weak, the charters' purpose is to just to die and you don't care when they do. You seen it all before done much better. The movie made to play off nostalgia of the Predator and First Three Alien movies that were good, and to steal your money and time. This should be rated a Zreo but can't put that. Please people stop going to these and buying these horrible movies like this. Maybe then studios will try to make something at least that showed some effort then to trick you out of and every other movie goers time and MONEY!</comment>

    <title>The West Wing Complete Series</title>
    <comment>If you love "The West Wing" this is the best way to get it all. The show is great, but let's discuss the boxed set: The whole thing comes in attractive faux briefcase. Each season comes in a file folder, there is also a booklet with plenty of photos and a replica of the pilot script. But the best thing about the box set over the individual season sets is that these discs are single sided, thus giving them less chance to get scratched up. Overall a very good set of a very good show. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Great Album</title>
    <comment>Amy Winehouse is a great new artist. Her voice is raw, beautiful, and deep at the same time. She has made an album that deserves to be admired. The songwriting is great. One thing I can say is that her singles are the songs on the album that sound the most modern. The rest of the album is very different. This album is definitely something different and a great representation of emotion. I would definitely recommend it, but first listen to a couple of songs before you buy it. It's a very mature sound.</comment>

    <title>Exceeded Expectations</title>
    <comment>I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about a FF7 DVD, being a huge fan of the game and all. I'm really glad I decided to buy it and give it a chance. This DVD can be summed up in one word: Amazing. The storyline starts where the game left off and does a great job of tying in with everything that happened in the game. To add to it's greatness, it has a FF7 recap so those who have not played the game in awhile can easily remember what happened. The graphics are breath-taking and the sound is a exceptional. This is a must for ANY Final Fantasy VII fan.</comment>

    <comment>Overall: a great buy that i've listenedto almost evryday since the purchase. Great track list full of the songs that made Everclear famous and kept them going strong. Ten Years Gone: TheBest of Everclear 1994-2004 is just a great way to recap and relive all the times you heard each of their hitsforthe first time. A most excellent music choice. 6 outof 5 stars</comment>

    <title>Hesitant at first and then loved it</title>
    <comment>When i first listened to this album, I didn't really like it all that much. I think partially because Bizzy Bone is not on this cd. Then the second way through it I realized how crazy the beats and lyrics are and now I love to listen to this cd the whole way through. Some of my favorite songs though are Flow Motion and Bump in the Trunk</comment>

    <title>Great DVD.</title>
    <comment>Like many others, I was initially upset about the split of the two "Grindhouse" films. However, five months after its release, I was happier to see extended versions of each film than the theatrical version again (no doubt, I will want to watch it again by the time it's released on DVD). This version of "Death Proof," approximately 20 minutes longer than the "Grindhouse" version," is much better because of its new scenes. The film is full of extended dialog scenes, which make the movie great. Sure, they stray from the plot, but they're interesting and funny. Stuntman Mike has many great lines, as do both sets of women. The action scenes are impressive; the final car chase is insane: a woman is on the hood of a car going 70 miles per hour that's continually being rammed by Stuntman Mike in his death-proof car. The documentaries on the second disc are interesting, and this seems like a thorough special edition. The "Grindhouse"fake trailers could have been included, but that's only a minor problem. On the DVD, the first half of the film is still grainy and has its intentional editing mistakes (my favorite being the opening credits title). So far, this is the best movie of the year (excluding the full "Grindhouse").</comment>

    <title>Grudge match</title>
    <comment>If you grew up watching "A Nightmare On Elm Street" or "Friday The 13th" then you will enjoy the combination of Freddy and Jason going at it. You have the best of both worlds if you think of it, the dream demon vs an unstoppable foe, it's quite the match up. Watch it.</comment>

    <title>Simply AWSOME!</title>
    <comment>If your into murder mysteries, thrillers or dark comedies; this is the perfect series for you. Dexter(For the uninitiated) is like Silence of the lambs meets CSI. It follows Dexter Morgan a forensics scientist for the Miami Police department; who just so happens to be a serial killer. Things get hectic when a new serial killer"The Ice-Truck Killer" emerges and begins a cat and mouse game with Dexter. The Ice Truck Killer begins subtly leaving Dexter clues to his clouded past and the series ends with a twist that I can honestly say I never saw coming. The DVD's themselves are ok at best offering 2 commentaries and some behind the scenes work, but overall its a great series so far and an exceptional bargain at $24.99. I just can't recommend this set enough, just buy it already!</comment>

    <title>Best Purchase for Price</title>
    <comment>Am a CSI Las Vegas addict, and started purchasing the dvds at Best Buy. Some of them were worth purchasing directly at the store, others were not. Definitely check online pricing and availability before going to the store. However, overall, I would purchase at Best Buy before others due to availability of all the seasons, pricing, and for the rewards points which give back for future purchases. Great movie selections as well.</comment>

    <title>Sade... THE queen of musical style</title>
    <comment>Simply the best concert DVD I own, or have ever seen. I saw Sade and her band live in Las Vegas summer 2001 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena (completely sold out, of course). This DVD allows me to re-live the concert, AND it includes some nice extras, such as some backstage footage that Sade fans will definitely find interesting. For those who have not seen her in concert, for heaven sakes, buy this and you will understand why she and her band have such a devoted fan base around the world, having given us so many hits over the years. It's amazing how almost every song from all their CDs still sounds fresh and relevant. My only complaint (I should say "wish") is that they would record and tour more often. But I know they have other things going on too, and it's apparent they are into quality more than quantity. Although categorization is subjective, I would describe their music as soulful-jazzy-r&amp;b with pop elements... themes of love... in terms of romance, longing, and the beauty of human interaction. There are surely other words that could be used, but this is what it means to me, and I love and thank them for sharing their artistry. Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this DVD and any (all) of Sade's CDs. Great for romantic occasions, but definitely can be listened to anytime. ;-)</comment>

    <title>An Instant Classic</title>
    <comment>Children of Men is easily one of the best movies of the decade and a new classic in the science fiction genre, along with Blade Runner. But it also fits into the recent category of post 9/11/geopolitical thrillers which have a noirish and pessimistic outlook on where our world is heading. It is the best of this genre (which contains overrated movies like The Constant Gardener, Syriana, and Babel) because it doesn't point the finger at any particular enemy or problem but instead uses it's infertility plot as a plea for the planet to start respecting life. The movie is a thrilling action picture unlike any other: no fancy stuntwork or special effects but raw, harsh and gritty events that raise the tension and give a feeling of authenticity. The extras are average but the documentary titled The Possibility for Hope is the worst: it is merely a collage of unused footage with rambling commentaries that pigeonhole this complex allegory to the left-winged mentality; this movie is for both wings.</comment>

    <title>Ducktales Woo Hoo!</title>
    <comment>Overall I have been pleased with the fact that this series is being released onto DVD. Yes, the episode have not been put out in order of air date and yes there are 0 bonus features. But if you are like me and enjoyed the Ducktales, Rescue Rangers, Tale Spin, and Darkwing Duck Disney shows to probably an unhealthy dose (just kidding) as a kid then you'll want to have this in your DVD collection</comment>

    <title>Game Of The Year</title>
    <comment>This is the game of the year. If you have an Xbox 360, this is a must-have game. When I first started playing Halo 3, I was blown away with all the improvements from Halo 2. I thought it would never top Halo 2. The best thing about Halo is its multiplayer. You can have a LAN party and play with friends or play all over the world with Xbox Live! This game has ton of replayability which makes Halo 3 really fun. Halo 3 baby, HALO 3!!!</comment>

    <title>An end of a cult classic</title>
    <comment>Now you would hear from alot of people saying that this was the worst one of The Matrix movies, but thats because there wasn't that many trips back to The Matrix. This movie ends the saga and for me it went out a bang and I loved evey minute of it. This one was more of an action movie than a kunfu movie</comment>

    <title>Too Easy</title>
    <comment>As expected, Halo 3 offered excellent graphics and lots of excitement. The only problem is the excitement didn't last. Of all the Halo games, this was by far the easiest to solve, offering less than three days of play. After all the hype and anticipation, I was disappointed at the lack of challenge.</comment>

    <title>Amazing Series</title>
    <comment>If you haven't seen TWIN PEAKS, you've missed the best series to hit television in 30 years. David Lynch brought an air of menacing mystery to us in the early '90s once a week and spawned the catchphrase, "Who killed Laura Palmer?" This is a must-see, so buy it today!</comment>

    <title>Obi-Wan Kenobi meet Anakin Skywalker</title>
    <comment>The expectation to see the prequel of the original saga, Phatom Menace is good but not great because it was like watching a kids movie. Of course like everyone else, Jar Jar gets irrating but he plays major role so I can forgive Lucas for that. Darth Muhl was the least impressive, but if you look at each Star Wars movie, Lucas shows different types of Jedi and Sith.</comment>

    <title>Awesome Album</title>
    <comment>This is one of the best albums I have ever heard, I can listen to it over and over again without it becoming boring. I have to place them in a category of their own, because I wouldn't know who to compare them to. If your looking for a good album to buy, pick this one.</comment>

    <title>Jack Deth Rules</title>
    <comment>Tim Thomerson as Jack Deth. What a character. These movies are great and Charles Band does it again in making these low budget but great movies. Jack Deth is a great character filled with witty remarks. Lots of action in these movies. The reason for the 4 star instead of 5 is the video quality isnt much above VHS. I do advise people too get these films as they are fun and great.</comment>

    <title>A Great Movie!</title>
    <comment>This is a well done movie starring Dustin Hoffman, a father who is trying to gain custody of his young son after a bitter divorce with his wife, played by Meryl Streep. This is acting at its best as both Hoffman and Streep took home Oscars. Even the little kid, Justin Henry was nominated for an Oscar. A moving piece of work. Highly recommended.</comment>

    <title>Don't Talk, Just Listen</title>
    <comment>If you though B5 was just another boy band, this album proves you couldn't be more wrong. The Breeding brothers - Dustin, Kelly, Patrick, Carnell and Bryan have been compared to the Jackson 5. This album proves that they have the talent to be the band that defines their generation. The album starts with "Hydrolics", a collabo with rapper Bow Wow. From the potential club bangers "What It Do", "Right to Left" and "How You Not Gonna" to smooth, sweet ballads like "In My Bedroom", "She Got It Like That" and "All Over Again" the boys take you on a musical ride that makes you forget whatever preconceived notions you have about boy bands. This is an album that anyone who enjoys good music will appreciate. B5 is sure to gain new fans of all ages with this album.</comment>

If you like any type of modern Christian music, then do yourself a HUGE favor and pick up this album, where Christian rock started from.</comment>

    <comment>I won't give this a full five but it doesn't deserve a four either. For the biggest game ever we deserved a game that had more than 10 hours of play. If games are going to get more detail but less game that is not a step in the right direction.</comment>

    <title>Best New Drama of 2006</title>
    <comment>For those of you who haven't become addicted to the phenomena that is Heroes, but are intrigued by the concept Season 1 is a must own. The first season is full of enough twist and turns to keep you guessing. And the way that each episode ends leaves you hanging is enough to entice you to watch the next. If you are wanting to find another series to add to your weekly TV rotation, this is the one. Season 2 just started, so purchase Season 1 to catch up and you can watch the first few episodes of Season 2 on CBS' website.</comment>

    <comment>This movie falls into the entertaining but predictable moves category. If you are not expecting much and just need a fun movie to watch to escape the real world for two hours, this would be the movie to watch. Besides that, the acting is not the greatest and Julia Stiles is not a convincing dancer at all.</comment>

    <comment>This was the best batman movie out since Batman Returns. In this movie Batman is scary to the bad guys not just a guy who can take them all out. I would have loved to see some of the other villians that Batman fought beside the scare crow and Ali Ra. It was a nice pace to see how Bruce Wayne became batman.</comment>

    <comment>I bought this the first day it came out and have not stopped playing it since. the campaign on easy takes about 4 hours and on Legendary it takes about 8 hours to finish. The online is good but the ranked online game types are kind of bland. There is not "only snipers game type or SWAT like in Halo 2. The online achievements are really easy and you can pretty much get every campaign achievement just playing through on legendary. Overall this is a very good game.</comment>

    <title>A cult classic</title>
    <comment>While some 21st Century science fiction has crashed and burned(the TV shows Andromeda and Star Trek: Enterprise, anyone?), other works of the genre have fared better. Among them is this Steven Spielberg gem, which is the followup his other memorable downbeat sci-fi film, A.I.-Artificial Intelligence. Laced with 9/11 overtones, this Philip K. Dick adaptation rivals Blade Runner and Total Recall as the correct way to adapt the author's notoriously difficult works to the screen. While we may mock Tom Cruise these days for his couch-hopping antics, this film is solid proof that he can, in fact, act. His John Anderton is a pitiable, tortured, paranoid man who, thanks to Cruise's skillful acting, the audience instantly sides with when the revolutionary system of capturing killers before they kill targets him. The supporting cast, which includes Colin Farrell, Max Von Sydow, Jessica Harper, and a pre-Cold Case Kathryn Morris, is also first rate, each portraying memorable characters. The scene stealer, though, is Samantha Morton as the genetically-treated woman who holds the key to Anderton's fate. It's a performance that is both scary and heartbreaking and should've earned Morton 2002's Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Spielberg's behind-the-scenes triumvirate of Michael Kahn(editing), Janusz Kaminski(cinematography), and John Williams(music) do their usual fantastic jobs. One word of warning: this film, like A Clockwork Orange(though not quite as explicit), is not for all tastes. There are a number of scenes which urge that its PG-13 rating be heeded(including a nice homage to the aforementioned Kubrick film).</comment>

    <title>I love this cleaner</title>
    <comment>I just love my Hoover Steamvac carpet cleaner. The price is great and it is easy to put water and cleaner in the machine and to empty the water well after you are done cleaning your floor. You are only lifting about 1 gallon to fill and empty. This makes it ideal for older people as well as younger. You also do not have to worry about being hooked up to a water source since it is all independant. I have 2 dogs and live in the midwest and would not want to be without it.</comment>

    <title>Excellent Movie!</title>
    <comment>I would definitely recommend anyone this movie. This movie gives you the chance to see Transformers in life-like robots, but it won't surpass the original animated Transformers movie! Special effects were great, had great direction, and it was really action packed! My only con is that they left out characters that should've been in this one, but I would assume they would make a sequel out of this. I would go watch the second one, if they are going to make it.</comment>

    <comment>i wanted to like 28 weeks later a lot more than i did,but i kept thinking of the original movie, which was far superior.the acting is a little weaker in the sequel,however,there is far more violence in the sequel.so,give it a try you can't go wrong this time of year around halloween with a pseudo zombie movie.</comment>

    <title>Best thing on tv in a long time</title>
    <comment>I was totally gutted when I learned NBC has decided to remove this show. It was the best thing on telly in a long time. I totally loved the show. So much so that I'd watch it online as I didn't always have time to watch it during its airing and didn't have Tivo. I just wish it gets revived on some other channel. As one of the other reviews say, it would be an absolute pleasure if you like this genre.</comment>

    <title>What's New? NOTHING!</title>
    <comment>If you have any previous version of Halo don't waste your money on Halo 3 unless you simply are one of those people who have to have a copy of everything in a series. If you've already read other reviews you probably already know not to buy the "Limited" edition of the game as the packaging is the worst excuse for design and will likely gaurantee that your disk will be severely scratched and possibly unplayable. Serious people- are we gamers really so sususceptible to the hype? Yes, I preordered my copy (though that was not necessary as I don't know of any stores in my community that haven't kept it in stock since the release date) because I was/am a big Halo fan. Does Halo 3 live up to the hype? Not even close. Nothing new (ok you get to drive a 4-wheeler) and the brutes being the main apponents is such a dissapointment as they offer no real challenge compared to the Elites which are far more threatening and interesting to battle. Even the Jackels have lost their skills and are really no more a threat than the little silly sounding grunts. Nothing special with weapon improvements, no new, improved moves or abilities and the graphics are no better than the previous Halo versions (unless you like to watch a bush shake as a character brushes against it). Like others, I couldn't wait to get Halo 3 in my new Xbox 360 Elite. Although I bout the 360 and a new HD TV a few weeks prior to the Halo 3 release, I truly decided to go ahead and spend the $ because Halo 3 was coming out. I'm thankful there are other games. Soon after putting the game in and sitting down with high expectations I found my mood sinking with dissapointment. Not that Halo 3 isn't a good game; it's just that there is nothing improved at all over previous versions (and if anything it is less fun). It did get my blood up for Halo again though and while I haven't finished Halo 3, I have been playing Halo 2 again (and physically ducking and shifting in my chair as I battle an Elite- a reaction Halo 3 hasn't come close to causing). Halo 3 hasn't even been back in my console since 9/27/07. Halo and Halo 2 are much better games, much more challenging and the Elite are far more interesting, challenging, and intense in battle than are the Brutes. Halo 3 has given a whole new meaning to the saying "Two is company and three is a crowd". My copy is taking up space in my case. As a result of it's being the number 3 that makes up my crowd, I gave it 3 stars. Halo and Halo 2 still rate 5 stars in my book.</comment>

    <title>Final Mutants</title>
    <comment>I don't know for some reason I think Hugh Jackman's character wolverine is really hot. I always liked Halle berry's character strom; that would be so cool if I had her powers to control the weather. Xmen has always been my favorite cartoon; since they made them into movies I fell in love all over again! This movie is great! Lots of suspense and action. Its quite sad though because Xavier dies but I still loved this movie.</comment>

    <comment>I love this movie! I found it very intriguing because a closet took those kids to a magical world. I had fun watching it; its a great movie for children. I teaches morals that they could learn. This is such a great movie that I had to watch it over and over and over again. If you use your imagination you can create a whole new world and that is definitely cool!</comment>

    <title>Sparta!</title>
    <comment>The reason I liked this movie was because it was about a community that didn't want to give up their freedom to a so called god. I admired their courage and strong character traits. This was such a great movie. The characters were very interesting; I loved every part of this movie. This is Sparta! That is my favorite line; the ending is breath taking. It's such a beautiful movie.</comment>

    <comment>This was a really funny movie. I liked everything about it and you also learn something from it. It would be cool to have a remote control like that...I would have lots of fun with it. This is such a great family movie. I would definitely advise you to buy this movie...you will laugh your head off! Adam Sandler is the funniest guy alive!</comment>

    <comment>I loved the whole plot of this movie. It really touched me because there are a lot of corrupt governments in this world. It was one of those sentimental movies that make you really feel what the characters are feeling and going through. This is such a great movie; I love it! It broadens your mind about the world. I really liked the character V, he is so cool. His passion for justice was intriguing; it was just sad that he had to die.</comment>

    <comment>This game is great; 30 more stars than the one for 64. 150 stars! All new levels to play and new mini-games too. Play with up to three frends in action levels. Find secret stars as you play, throughout the castle.Use each charcture's special moves. (Yoshi, Mario, Luigi, and Wario). The graphics are great. This game also features "dray play", use the stylus to draw a picture then... You'll just have to find out yourself!</comment>

    <title>Great Game!</title>
    <comment>This is a great game with top-notch graphics. Even though the constant firing of weapons gets a little monotonus at times, the game redeeems itself with a variety of weapons to choose from and vehicles to pilot in order to advance in the game. The evironment is massive and even though it is not completely open-ended the surroundings envoke a feeling that there is more world beyond your current position even though you may not be able to travel there.</comment>

    <title>Greatest Game Ever!</title>
    <comment>I absolutely love this game and would recommend this game to any Xbox 360 owner. The campaign may be short and a bit unsatisfying but searching for skulls, scoring points on how well you do, and cooperative play can make it very exciting. Also, the multiplayer is great! I noticed a difference between Halo 2's multiplayer and Halo 3's. Halo 3's is better in my opinion. The only problem I've been having with the multiplayer is that when I hit someone before they hit me and we both have about the same damage, I will die first. Many players have experienced this. It may be frustrating but everything else in the game makes up for it! If you have an Xbox 360 AND Xbox Live, get this game! Your skill doesn't matter because there's always people who are at your skill that you can play against online. This game is great for anyone who has ever enjoyed a First-Person Shooter.</comment>

    <title>Hard to Watch</title>
    <comment>This movie is NOT a remake of "A Long Kiss Goodnight". It is based on a novel of the same name. This movie asks whether we can forget our past and rebuild our lives. What the definition of family is. If there is such a thing as "good" violence. How we define ourselves. This movie is dark, very dark. The film is intentionally gory. There is nudity. The acting is superb. David Cronenberg's direction is excellent. This movie is not for everybody, given the reasons above. Please consider the viewing audience before watching. This is not a family movie and any view with children is probably not a good idea. It is an excellent film with real questions.</comment>

    <title>Excellent CD</title>
    <comment>The best thing I can say about this CD is that over the years, I've bought 5 copies for myself and as gifts for my friends! If you like hard rock with catchy tunes, then this is the CD for you. All the songs on this CD are winners and that is almost unheard of in my experience. My favorite songs, if I had to choose, would be She Hates Me, Drift and Die and P*** It All Away.</comment>

    <title>Excellent Game</title>
    <comment>This game toppled it's predecessors by far in every category with the exception of online lag. With the atrocious amount of users often the server does not seem able to support everyone, and you get messages saying it can't retrieve any information (many, many gamers have experienced, not just myself.) However, there are two incredible alternatives: campaign and forge.</comment>

    <title>awesome group game!</title>
    <comment>this game really is awesome. but, its best played with a group of friends, or with the family. playing it one player, i got over it kind of quick. but, i keep going back and playing a little while (single player) regardless. the most fun though comes in competing against friends in realistic carnival style games. each time you do well you win a small medium or large prize, and you can keep trading prizes in for bigger ones. also, during the game secret prizes will be unlocked like costumes for your character. it really keeps me coming back wanting to do better, just like a real carnival. i always think i can sink at least one more ring on ring toss! carnivals games include, ring toss, balloon darts, horse racing, frog leap, test your strength, putt putt, skee ball, basketball, shooting the clowns mouth with water, milk jugs, shoot out the star, and sooooo many more! if you are looking for a fun game that can get you and your friends and family interacting and competing for big prizes, go out and get this game. it wont disappoint. you can almost smell the fried food now!</comment>

    <comment>Never before, have I been so ecstatic to learn that one of my favorite childhood shows has arrived on dvd. Pinky and the Brain is one of those rare cartoon series, that don't cater to kids with gross out humor and adult innuendo. Watching it now in my adult years has given me a greater appreciation for this show. It is comical, it is smartly written, and it has a broad appeal to be certain. The features on this dvd are very much interesting to the adult obessessed cartoon collector who enjoy seeing the work that went into this masterful creation. I am pleased to find that Pinky and the Brain has stood the test of time, at least in my eyes!</comment>

    <title>Captivating to the core</title>
    <comment>Let me begin by saying its a great movie. You will definitely enjoy this movie not only because Anthony Hopkins is as stellar always but also because all characters in the movie blend in really well together which makes this movie a must have. The only drawback is if you analyze a few parts of the movie, it is a little unconvincing how certain actions can be prejudged to happen exactly as planned but comparing to the grand sheme of things it is minor at most.</comment>

    <title>Break it up</title>
    <comment>To be honest the movie is funny but it's about two people who are in their mid-thirties who act like 12 year olds.People in that age bracket don't seem to fight like children.It's about a couple having problems with their relationship,but neither is willing to give up their condo.What would have been a lot better if they had a younger cast star in the movie.Someone in their 20's would have been more of a believable movie.</comment>

    <title>U.S. vs. Japan (WWII)</title>
    <comment>The story from the Japanese point of view of World War II is to some a welcomed dilemma. Clint Eastwood tells how the Japanese soldiers' code of ethics comes into play for warfare. Honor is everything to them. It has very graphic battlefields; with a tease of humor, compassion, and respect for the enemy.</comment>

    <title>Eh, ok Movie</title>
    <comment>Angelina Jolie is Lara Croft, in an epic battle between good and evil. If you ever played the game, KEEP playing it, the movie isn't anywhere near as cool as the game. People thought the movie was awesome?! I will admit, that there is some good battle scenes, but other than that, it wasn't the best. At least in the game, you can pretend that you are Lara, but in the movie, you can get really bored and tired.</comment>

    <title>Lon Chaney jr.'s definitive roll</title>
    <comment>The Wolf Man is the kind of old school horror movies that makes you wish every horror movie was made this way. Lon Chaney jr. is fantastic as the ill fated Larry Talbot who, while visiting his father in England, gets bit by a werewolf played by the legendary Bela Lugosi (Dracula). Soon after Larry is told by a gypsy that her son that bit him was a werewolf and that he will become one too. He is in disbelief at first but later that night his fears become a reality as he bears claws and fangs. His rampage lasts a few nights but he finally meets his fate at the hands of his own father played by another fantastic actor Claude Rains. The other movies on this set are the also fantastic Frankenstein meets the Wolfman, She-wolf of London, and Werewolf of London.</comment>

    <title>Successful throwback to 70s and 80s horror</title>
    <comment>Cabin Fever, Eli Roth's first feature length film, is a wonderful throwback to 70s and 80s horror for us horror film buffs out there. The film is full of minute details and clever references to some of the old cult favorites (most notably Evil Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre). Roth's idea of having a flesh eating virus as the antogonist is a nice stroke of originality and adds a nice twist to the usual zombie/demon/friends possessed genre. It also adds an extra layer of eerieness as it makes the horror a bit closer to reality. Beyond that unique twist though, Cabin Fever isn't 100% successful as a standalone horror movie. It becomes more of a constant nod and wink fest to old school horror fans, but never quite becomes its own film. Don't get me wrong, it's great to have a film that brings back the feel of old school horror, but Cabin Fever doesn't quite do enough to transcend its referential nature. Looking beyond the movie itself, much like the DVD for Roth's sophomore feature Hostel, the DVD presentation for Cabin Fever is killer (no pun intended...okay, maybe a little). There are some fun short films from Roth's pre-Cabin Fever years, an entertaining, if not entirely deep behind the scenes documentary, and best of all, five amazing feature length commentaries. After hearing the Hostel commentaries and now moving on to the ones for Cabin Fever, Eli Roth has now established himself as one of the best commentators around in my opinion. He is engaging, informative, and a non-stop talker. Not only that, but the quality remains consistently high across all five commentaries, with little to no overlap. For horror film fans as well as eager film students, Eli Roth's commentaries should not be missed. Cabin Fever is an enjoyable throwback to the horror films of yesteryear, and it's given awesome treatment on DVD that should not be missed.</comment>

    <title>Best Album Yet</title>
    <comment>This album was simply incredible. Don't expect a "Dangerously In Love" 2 because this was totally different from that album. she's so aggressive, sassy, sexy, powerful, and even vulnerable on this album. she uses some samples from the 60's and 70's and she also had some Hot tracks from swiss beatz, Rodney Jerkins, and even Ne-yo. My favorite songs are deja vu, Green Light, Irreplaceable, and Resentment( she sang her but off on that track)</comment>

    <comment>Unlike the other reviews - I liked this movie much better than the first. More in line with other Zombie movies. Loved the gore!!</comment>

    <title>Dangerously In Love with this album</title>
    <comment>WOW! this album was amazing. It starts out with all the tracks everyone knows from the radio like crazy in love, naughty girl, and baby boy, but then the album slows down with some smooth R&amp;B tracks that she used a lot of music from the 70's on. She has tracks where she's belting it out like you've never heard her and she also has some tracks that are so smooth you could fall asleep too. My favorite track on this album is a song called "Speechless" it's the longest song on the album about 6 minutes and she will have you speechless with the ridiculously amazing high note at the end of the song. she also did the remake of the closer i get to you with Luther Vandross, which is one of the last tracks he recorded before he died. this album is a very classic album that i still love today</comment>

    <title>Flags Of Our Fathers</title>
    <comment>A young cast of men are put on an Island to eradicate the Japanese forces that are bunkered down and ready for a fight. Don't blink when the storming of the beaches or you will be sorry. It looks just like the movie 'Saving Private Ryan' on of the events of June 1944, see Battle of Normandy beginning battle.</comment>

    <title>Louder!! Louder!!! Louder!!!!</title>
    <comment>When testing my newly installed surround sound system, this dvd was the thirst quencher that this new system so desperately needed. In other and mo'profound(Is that a word? Of course it is, you just read it!) words, it needed to ROCK! Man, did it ever! This concert shook the house! This dvd was filmed in 35mm Panavision with 26 cameras! So, you want to see AC DC LIVE? You'll want to see this too. Also, as a precautionary measure, let the pets out and please have 911 on speed dial!</comment>

    <title>Excellent Popcorn Movie!</title>
    <comment>The FF series is a demonstration of how to make popcorn movies - movies you can watch, enjoy and then forget immediately after. Not on par with the first two X-Men or the Jack Nicholson or Christian Bale Batman movies as big-screen realizations of comic books, "Silver Surfer" still manages to bring to the screen the iconic character, well-voiced by Lawrence Fishburne, in a solumn but respectable fashion. This series, especially this edition, is heavy on the laughs, but the cast takes it seriously enough (except for Mr. Fantastic's take on Happy Feet) to make it work. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm, the never-take-anything-serious-but-the-pursuit-of-self-gratification Human Torch, is superb - you want to slug him at the same time as you crack up at his behaviour. Good family fun!</comment>

    <title>works but not worth it</title>
    <comment>This product does work but isn't well designed or well made as others have already noted. It needs a temperature sensor to adjust its fan speeds (and optimize battery life).</comment>

    <title>Pretty good</title>
    <comment>I love Kanye. He's awesome. This CD is quite good minus "Drunken Hot Girls" and add in a few more tracks. I love that he went paper with the designs. Absolutely gorgeous. I miss the skits. Where's Bernie Mac at? Overall, I do recommend this CD.</comment>
